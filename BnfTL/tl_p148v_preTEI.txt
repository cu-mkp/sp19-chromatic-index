Molding turtles

Next, reassemble the parts of your mold and clamp
carefully all the joints, as much as above & below as on the sides,
having not forgotten to notch the joints of the molds, as with
others. Having clamped it all, undo the clamps on the
side & not the others. And thusly, your mold of several
pieces sem will open as if it were only in two
halves. If you want to mold hollow, make in the middle of the of
the partmold of the belly a hole, from side to side,
which, inside, is of such capacity that the end of a little
finger can almost enter it, widening like a clervoise
the outside of the hole. This is to cast the noyau. But, note
that all these difficulties would be nothing if you wanted
to mold hollow because you could mold your turtle in two pieces
 and burn it inside, as with other animals, and it
would be done quickly. But since the turtle is massive &
that it is weighty, without being hollow, one considers better molded in
this way, hollow, and in cha this fashion, to
make well a mold, one really needs three
days. Take heed, for hollow & fanciful
molds, to have some strong plaster, which endures the
fire without bursting, if it is possible. But, if you cannot have any
such, mix a little more alum de plume & add to it
also some crocum, which fortifies it & makes the
flaws, if there are any, come out so finely that they are easily undone.
Also do not forget to tighten well, with a press, your
molds, to avoid flaws which are made either when the
mold is not well joined or when it bursts. To repair, if the
features are not apparent enough, retrace them lightly with a
burin, then soften them with a small chisel. The flaws
are removed with the chaple, a type of
burin. For the lumps & scales, they are made either with a
little gouge or a little round cutting-punch, or with
the point of a small chisel, not tempered & struck on a
small file. 

Make this hole before molding
joining your molds.

Soldering a vise

It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high to make
a long piece in it, and that the jaws join well to clamp a delicate
object. To solder the nut, after you have forged the
bolt, you will make will forge a long iron
stripquar of such thickness that it can fit
into the notch of the bolt when red hot, & you will bend it
po all around, striking it with a hammer.
Once it is well jo wrapped around, you will insert
it the bolto around which
is it is wrapped.


Copper

If, in the fire &melting, it touches the iron, this
iron will be afterwards so brittle that it will be able to be
forged.


Casting of lead

One mixes it, according to some, with halftin &
halflead and, to heat it,
one mixes in a little sublimate. It casts well in small sizes in
a cuttlefish bone, provided it is good.


Molding of Paper

Boil over hot ashes some cotton in
aquafortis mixed with sal ammoniac, like
aqua regia, and the cotton will become very fine,
like powder. Mix it next it with gummed water & you will cast
very delicately.


Almond trees, apricots

They come in quite straight if one grafts them. And all trees with
pitted fruit, like pavis,
mericotons, alberge,
vieapricots &c., comes in best on an
almond tree grafted en escusson.


Lasting of lead and copper

Lead & tin come out well in white chalk but
the softer it is the better. The one from Champaigne reaches
the price that is fixed in Lyon. Burnt & calcined
horse bones mold very neatly.


I believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen or
sheep, that is to say, the spongy bone from the
inside, molds very neatly and is better than bone.


Note that all brittle metal comes out better than fat ones. Also,
lean sand receives it better & absorbs it rather than the
dense one.

Plants that are awkward to burn in the mold

Mold them with two or three gates, which once reheated will open
& it will be easier for you to take away the charcoal from
inside.


Try


Letters and molded paper

Write with well gummed ink or with any color which has body
& which does not erase once moistened with eau-de-vie.
Then, place your paper on a clay slab &
moisten it with eau-de-vie and cast on one side & the
other.


For adorning beds, mirrors, and
suchlike

Rough out some design in half relief on a quite flat
slate to adapt it to either round or flat things. And having
cast it in mixed tin, quite thin, you can gild it with
gold leaf, & adapt it to whatever you want, and fill the
vui bottom of the relief with small rubies,
orpiment, & little grains of diverse colors.


For teaching a dog well

It is necessary to keep it tied up & when it does what you
command it, to make it love you, give it some cheese that has
been held under your armpit. Which must be a bad drug both for
the master, if he is red-haired, and for the apprentice
too.


Molded waxes

Figures of wax composed of ceruse & lead
white are not for burning & melting in a mold where you
want to cast gold & silver, for this would sour it.
And then, if you think about taking away these waxes composed of
things coming from the metals reheated in the mold, you
will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire, making them boil
ir, the wax goes away & the composition
of the ceruse or other metallic color, attacks the mold.
And for this reason, if you want to rough out something

+
Nota
White wax is more delicate than the other & it does not leave
any filth when you want to make noyau and mold
hollow.

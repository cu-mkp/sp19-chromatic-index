Damasked cloth

You can damask a cloth with two different colors and imitate
embroidery without adding anything else to it, in this way. Once it is
dyed yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
Then you will baste some string or a thicker cord onto the
pouncing and throw it into a dye of guesde woad
or pastel woad & it will become green, except that
which is beneath the string, which will remain yellow because the
green dye will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
with other colors, and instead of cord or string, add some
pieces of paltry cloth, cut into moresque shapes, on top of the
first color. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.


Foundry casting

One casts candlesticks and small works in a frame with
sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles it with
flour in order to make the e metalcopper or latten run better. When the sand has been used
for a month, it is necessary to take some new, because the one
that was used, having been reheated in fire+, dries out & loses its ability to bond. However,
it is used to mix among the new, for it makes the work not so porous.
One casts large works such as artillery, bells & similar things in
earth, & copper cast in earth makes less of a
chappe, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The
earth is sandy clay mixed with horse dung
& cloth waste. That which is has been used for
founding, which is black, baked & as if burnt, is used to cast,
gecte mixed with artificial sand, & is
very good. /To soften & make the copper run, throw in,
once it is melted, a little lead, which does not form an alloy
but is found on the surface of the cast.

Casting gold and silver

It is necessary that the sand be from something very dry & arid
& reheated well in the frame, because, if it were humid,
like founder's sand, the gold and silver
would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the
earth to drink the metal, for cast gold or
silveris becomes very spongy. That is why it must be
beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon
handles.

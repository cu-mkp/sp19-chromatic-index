Gate



When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a snake,
make it come from the side of the belly & under the tail, for from
the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
repair than the back, which is more visible & more marked.


Repairing fins



Having gently removed them with the point of a chaple or
burin, scrape them with the side of the burin, or gently
with a small file, & rub with willow
charcoal & little brushes. Make continuous the lines
disturbed by the fins.


Leady silver



It degrades a lot, because the lead, which is mixed in, works it
like in the cupel, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the crucible, & on the charcoal which
covers it. It is also fat, and thusly it is good to melt all coined
silver, like reals & others, & to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting lizards & animals, for it
comes out better. I molded with it neatly thus, first of all, a
little viper of silver, and made the alloy out of 4
reals, of 20 sols from
Spain, & a coin of xx
sols from France.


Blowing



When you melt silver & gold, do not blow strongly
& with violence, because with the charcoalconsolidating, the crucible would lower &
the silv could fall over. But when your mold is
ready, at that moment blow strongly to heat well the silver or
gold. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with a
little bellows, especially gold, for this removes their
smoke & softens them.

 either of earth or blades of copper, or iron,
or wood covered with white iron, to bury more easily these
aforementioned molds between the sheets of
copper, & the stirrup or screw of
iron.


Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not
got

Take some white wax which is more appropriate for this work
than anything else, because it is firmer & does not leave as much
filth, as much as you need to mold the animal that you propose,
& no more, and half as much charcoal, pestled &
finely passed through a linen or a sleeve.
The charcoal gives color and body to the wax,
which would otherwise be transparent & the features would not be
seen as well. Therefore, put your wax to melt in the
charcoal fire. And as it is well melted & liquid, have, for a
bowl with handles full of melted wax, as much
sulphurlaas a large
walnut. Pulverize it, melt it over a slow fire & when
it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become
too hard, but take it away, & always agitate it with a
little stick & let it finish its bubbling & as it is
liquid as water, throw it in the wax that you have removed
from the fire. And mix & always stir the one & the other, in
order that they mix well. Next, mix in, always stirring & in several
goes, the above said pulverized charcoalin several
goes. And as it will be well incorporated, take heed if
your wax has passed its high heat, which you will recognize
when it no longer smokes, when it makes large tracts
sere pulling at the
edges, & motionless, & close to one to another.
For, if you were to cast too hot, you could not separate your wax
from the mold, & it would set in the cast. When it is in
this good state, stir it with a little stick, in order that
thepulverized charcoal is everywhere & not placed
at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your mold, little by
little, & not in one go, because the wax, by its
unctuousness, does not flow




This black sulphured wax is for modelling round figures that are
not for releasing, and that one needs to burn in the mold Ã 
noyau before opening it, po like those
which have arms & legs out front or entwined. And then this
wax, by means of sulphur, melts with very little heat, and
exits without leaving any filth. If, by chance, the pestled
charcoal remains there as ash, by opening the mold
& blowing inside, it stays neat.


@To make snakes with wax, or another thing to fix on a
candle, one needs to cast with modelling wax, in all
colors.

to rest on a very clean & smooth table, & since it
is desiccative, I knew it would dry out lor, what I
let it do in order to reduce it to powder, & molding it with sand,
once broken up with my fingers & the sharp edge of
a knife. I oiled my medal because oil cleans it
without spoiling it. And And having dried it & cleaned it
with a linen, & small bristle brushes of
pork, I once again lightly oiled it with clear
walnut oil, & gently passed a linen
over it, so that it does not remain too oiled, and I noted that,
in this way, it would come out better in release, because the
ceruse, once moistened with water of glair of egg, would not
attach to the oil. This worked very well and I molded a medal of
high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of
good sands, such as felt, burnt bone & iron
dross, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my
mold became hard like marble, and I realized with this,
that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
water, which gives them body & compactness, like glair of egg, gummed water, eawine boiled
with elm root, & and lightly oil the medal, it
withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as
glass. But even soft lead & brittle tinv want to be cast very hot.

Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is
excellent & endures many castings & molds very neatly, it is
however fat and makes things porous. This, soft leadand
the does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a lean
sand, such as pumice, flakes, & similar things, to
give them body, & so that they release better. For lean sands
barely release well and yet they receive metal well.


Try to mix ceruse or minium with other sands.
X
Oil & smear with aspic oil, which will go
away when reheating, for the oil makes it porous.


One ought to moisten with glair, then mix it well. And once in
the frame, beat it on top with a pestle, or other
proper thing, for this makes it mold better and release better. 


It would be good to fill the frame all at once, for the
mixture, made of several sands with the one of the
mine, with which you fill the frame, corrupts
it.


Green varnish for medals of copper

Having casted them very neatly, cover them with sel de
verre that we use for sand, & moisten it, & in three or
4 days it will be green. Oil them after & keep
them under the dung.


Glue

The Flemish reglue their earthen pots with
gold color, that is to say minium, massicot, &
varnish.

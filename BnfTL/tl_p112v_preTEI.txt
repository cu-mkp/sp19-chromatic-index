to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie or else mix a bit with the vinegar. And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses
vinegar and erurine. But for small
ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done sooner. 


When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it scrupulously of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like
lizards have, and then apply thusly.



now put enough in a glass, & soak there & keep there
continually the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.



Take head, before it dies,to keep the eyes open, es
by blocking the eyelids with a little of wax or something
else.


Mouler Making the arrangement and disposition
of the animal

Having made provision of fat earth called
clay, that should be grey, because that commonly the best, or
another which has good binding & will should well prepared &
beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
hands nor the work, make a lazagne or like a
torteau of this earth equally flattened with a round
stick, which pastry-makers use, which should be a little
thicker than a poulce. And on this
tourtelle, arrange your animal, aya
imitating in that its nature, & fa the fashion in
which it is commonly shaped. And firstly, with a good needle,
pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, & up to
u  the top bone of the head. Retract the
needle, & in its place & its hole, put the point of
an iron wire, of such a length that it suffices to hold the
head of the animal as q high as it must be, & if
the skin gets in to the inside & when you put in the
point, pull it out with apoint the edge of your small pincers, &
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the
tourtelle of clay. Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace &once fixed, arrange after the gesture
of the body, & the feet, & the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you
throw in the sand, mects secure the legs
& le corp with little points of iron
wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp
needle. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary,
plantant making sure that the points
passing through the animal are fixed in the tourtelle of earth,
and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
by a



Take a fine needle of steel, & which is the sharpest
possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the points
of iron, it passes without forcing anything, & by its
harshness, does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a bigger
point of iron in thick places, & thin ones in thin
places. But head as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
point passed through the animal in the slab of earth,
pour but having planted it, take it out of the
earth & not out of the animal, & fais
ains next, fix it. This is done because by fixing it the
first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake and by taking
the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.



When you put the points again you have already used, clean them
well of rust, so that they do not take away some skin.



The main layout of your arrangement is to di place
the head raised & looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
on a solid plank or table& , making the
point pass through the bottom of the throat,
sâ€™arrestan entering into the top of the head

Talcum mixed in the molds

I took the one from which I had pulled the oil. I crushed it
very finely even more s into a steel
mortar with a pestle, very lumpy like a file. I
rendered it very fine & in a cottony & downy powder. I mixed it
with sand & mixed it together & cast it in noyau. It
molded en no very neatly & one ought not doubt
that it holds in the fire.


Gold cast very thinly

When goldsmiths have something to solder quickly
and do not have leisure to forge it, they melt some from
gold, and then throw it on a cloth or other
things that withstand the fire, and they flatten it immediately
with a hammer or similar thing. And it ends up very thin &
even receives the impression of the cloth.

Fine gold, not alloyed, can be cast for medals,
but not for plants & lizards & very fine things if it
is not alloyed.

A pansy smeared with wheat oil can be cast
in alloyed gold.

And other thin leaves, but only if the branch is not too big, and
the leaves, especially, cast, can be soldered.


Counterfeit diamonds put in a work

Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with black wax
for esbaucher, then grease the inside, thus waxed, with
wheat oil, & then powder this with lamp smoke
for it is necessary that ceste its color not have
luster for false stones. This done, set in your stone& puys with a bit of wax, then with a
steel point & a small finishing hammer,
join the edge of the setting to the stone in order that
daylight does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
stone, which would break.

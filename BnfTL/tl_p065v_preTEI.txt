Semi-lively colors

When colors aabsorb into the canvas, it
means that it has been primed only once, & for this reason they
become matte without being shiny. But this is the best way,
as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
more body, do not die & are all the more beautiful for it,
especially azure ,lake & those do not have body. But
those who want to rush their painting prime twice on the first go, to be
done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as
long. The second layer of these does not absorb & remains
shiny.


Painting large figures

You need to put your charcoal at the tip of a stick
such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close,
you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain
& sufficient distance. Also, when you paint up close, hold your
charcoal at the farthest end, & practically with your
fingertips. For in this way you will acquire an
artist's l touch & give your hand
effortless facility.


Glazing

One usually glazes with colors which do not have body, such as
lake & verdigris. However, to use other kinds, one
mixes in plenty of calcined & crushed cristallin, which also
has no body & makes lightens their thickness.


White and black

It is good that an apprentice should work with white
& black for two or three years to become an
artist.


Lead white

It does not die & has a lot of body.


After nature

There are some who paint after nature on oiled paper, &
if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper &
unfinished picture in water so that it shall not dry.

Illuminators painting on paper temper their colors
with gum & mix in a little soap to make them run
better.

Painters must all learn how to draw after nature, for to them
it is travel provisions & revenue & sure means of earning their
passage when travelling across the lands with only their
cocon.


Priming layer

One needs to be quite careful about this, & not do it, as some
will, with gold color which is made with the washing water of
oilpinceaulx, because verdigris &
other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end cause the death
of the colors that are meu layered on next. It is
good to do it.



with ceruse, & a bit ofyellow ocher, &
a little massicot, & make it not too thick so that it does
not crack.

Painters

They completely melt orpiment in a glass
bottle on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to
sublimate orpiment in a long-necked matrass as for
making garnets. The orpiment thus turns red like red
enamel & one needs to grind it damp because once completely
melted it is very lively & difficult to grind. Next, you can
br thin it, once dry, with oil & it will
make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent orpiment
from dying with the other colors & to render it compatible with
these & to make it dry promptly, it is held a very rare secret to
calcine common salt & to grind it within. Green
verditer is not used with oil.

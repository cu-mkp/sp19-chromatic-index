such that while reheating the two casts will unjoin. Et
pour pl Therefore, for this effect, take several bowls of
different size, which have a lip, to cast better. In these pour
some common fountain water, & mix into it as
much essence of sal ammoniac as can be held in an
egg, # composed as mentionned.
If you want to cast in lead or tin - because one would
need more for casting gold & silver - the
essence once in your bowl, mesles
put y your sand in it & not the essence
in the sand & add it a dista distawith such
discretion that il, while stirring & mixing it
promptly with a wooden spoon, it does not become thicker
than clear mustard. And thus throw
le first the non-thick part, qui
es as is always at the surface, in shakes &
da at the top of your mold. And doing so,
since your animal is nearly covered, blow strongly everywhere in order
to dissipate the small and big bubbles that the wet sand makes &
continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, &
a little thicker than the top, until everything is filled, up to the
mark for thickness that you made.

 And do not forget to shake the moldaffin while throwing, in order that the wet sand runs
& enters well everywhere. Also tip your mold up on the side
of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your mold
will have the same thickness, & you will spare sand. All of this
being done scrupulously fai, let it set, which will
take a quarter of an hour. Then release the
clay circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry
a little bit, & separate your mold from the
tourtelleearth, which also de will
be appropriate for molding right away, and pare the excess with a big
knife, giving to it the long shape of a mandore.
Rasche Scrape & cut also away the back of
the mold, which is always the weakest, and adapt it
cleanly thusly. And do not forget to make notches around, in order that the
second cast anchors itself there & binds better

 without changing.

If you can, fill your half mold in one go & with
la pre one wet batch it is the best.

#or two eggs, because there is no risk if there is more.
Et lâ€™eauIf you cast in two goes, it is enough
to put essence of sal ammoniac at the first bowlful. 



Make it clear like a broth of juices, or like starchy
water, that women use to make their starch. For
there is no risk in it being very clear, because sand always settles in
the bottom & water separates & remains on top. The same
that one scrapes since it is too weak & soft. And it will not let
itself set quickly, for all things calcined dry out promptly from mixed
water.



If you don't fill in one go your molddestrempe with wet sand, take head to stir your
second cast with the e p surface of the first,
p by mixing with the spoon or a
spatula with which you wet it.

Essence of sal ammoniac is not necessary for small
molds, which do not require neither a big nor a long fire to be
reheated, however, when you put some in it will only be better.

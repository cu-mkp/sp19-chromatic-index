Animals dried in an oven

Small scats are skinned and one
removes their eyes &all their entrails. One puts a small
stick vertically between their teeth to make them open their mouths
wide. Then with iron points one attaches their feet to a
small board, giving them the fitting attitude & gait. Once
thus attached by their feet with small rings of iron
wire, one needs to suspend them in the sun
with their spines downwards. In this manner they take
&d their shape & dry, & the belly
tightens & the tail remains high or with the bend that you will
have given it. Once a little dry by this means, one turns the head
as one wants, securing it with some tool. Then one finishes drying it in
an oven after the bread is taken out. Next one places in its
eye sockets balls of lead or of wax, painted
according to nature. One paints them with well-gummed ink so that
they seem to be jet. One gives it a painted tongue, horns, wings &
similar fantasies. Thus for rats & all animals.



which surround the fingers of the paws and which stick in
the jacket of clay.


For reddening live crayfish, which will seem
boiled

Rub them in quite good vinegar, in which there should be a
little eau-de-vie & hardly any, & they can be served as
if cooked & will walk along.


Molding a single spider

One needs to plant it on the clay slab, as has been
said, on a vine leaf, and make there your first cast & once
it has set, uncover the spider up to half its legs, then make the
second cast.

In order The hairy feet of large
spiders, like any animal hair, does not mold well if it is not
flattened, having smeared it with wheat oil, which
stiffens it & is quickly dry. Hairy things mix with the sand &
do not burn well.


Molding a single vine leaf

Plant it with the points of fine ironlatten
wire & place diagonally on the clay slab,
then cast the first mold. Having set, uncover the
back reverse & make the second cast, which once set, you
can take away the leaf. And you will need to reheat your mold
only once, because there will be nothing to burn.

Against plague

Take, against pestilential fever or poison or plague, an
ecu's weight of your opiate soaked in
scabious or bugloss water,
or thoroughly tempered wine, if one is afflicted. After taking
it, one needs to make oneself sweat.


For preserving

Vinegar made from ruejuniper
berries crushed together. With this vinegarburning
bricks shall be extinguished. And the vapor shall be received
through the mouth &
nostrils. This is to preserve
oneself when one goes into corrupt air: a
garment can be thus perfumed & remove
infectionfrom it, from a
room, house, &c. If you find yourself in a place where
you do not have this preparation, carry
rue &
berriespestled together, then, according to
your need, boil them in vinegar and use as above.

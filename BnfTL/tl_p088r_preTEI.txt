the iron pestle is not tempered. If well made, the
metal mortar, because it is
sour. One makes, for this purpose, the bottom of large mortars
from fine copper.


Varnish

Turpentine oilturpentine & good eau-de-vie
to render it desiccative. Heat it without mixing on the chafing
dish, so that it mixes pu by itself when
melting. Next test on a very clean knife, & you will know
then if it has enough body & if it does not run too much.

One finds by experience that the graft that est
has its entrance into the incision on the sunny side takes very rarely,
when it is also bent.


Baker

it well when it is stained & like rust, pass ashes through
the sieve & mix them with the wheat, then
boult the whole with a boulting cloth of rough cloth or
canvas. The ashes will pass through & your
wheat will stay yellow, clean, & very
beautiful.

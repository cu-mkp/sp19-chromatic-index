Sand from rivertellins and
mussels

 The long shells that can be found in fresh
river waters, once calcined, makes an impalpable white sand, which
molds very neatly.


Congealing mercury

It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two
hours in a rather large iron posnet,
putting in, for an ℥ of
☿, ii ℥ of
verdetde and vitriol of
saltpetre, ana, with sufficient quantity of old
water from mareschaulx.

Or else, melt 4 ℥ of tin, & as
it cools, purify it of its filth, which is on top, then, make a
hole in it & put in there i ℥ of
☿ & it will come out like tin if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is
tin or ☿, redden a shovel &
put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is tin, it will melt
& stay, but if it is ☿, will quickly melt,
then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to congeal it in
a spoon or in a hollow crucible, & make a
moderately sized hole.

It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aqua
fortis which beforehand will have eaten a little silver.
This one, mixed, makes tin & lead run.


Mixture

Fine tin, congealed mercury with the smell of
tin, looking glass tin, fine lead, as much of
one as the other, makes a substance that melts very quickly, but
breakable & white. I think that it would be good for solder.
A long time to cool.

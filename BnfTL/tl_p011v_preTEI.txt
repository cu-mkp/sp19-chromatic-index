Color of damascene steel on knives

Rub the steel with common aquafortis, mixing the said
water with earth & next rub the whole with
ashes or sand & the gold
& the silver will touch as on a
touchstone.


For getting rid of the redness of eyes or bruising

Make two small thin slices of raw mutton flesh,
& with a head band, apply to the eyesat
night.


For coating with or mat

There is nothing better than the black varnish of
espasiers to make a ground layer
because it dries immediately & makes the gold appear very
beautiful.


For diamond points for engraving

These are for tracing what you want to draw on stones &
engrave, & when these points are fatty & cannot bite,
one needs to rub them diamond against diamond. One rubs
them with diamondpumice stone powder. One
needs also to unpolish on a lead wheel either the
stone or the glass on which you want to engrave, for the
polish, which is like varnish on glass, prevents the
diamond or sapphire from biting well. But This
is why it does not bite easily on the nail, which is
polished & fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
easily.


Polishing wheel of copper

Before polishing your stoneon it, it is necessary to degrease
ter it well, rubbing it with a piece of
leatheren tour on the flesh side while
spinning the wheel, if you have not worked on it in a long
time.

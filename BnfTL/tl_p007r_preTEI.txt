For gilding with gold color and tinsel

Once you have gildedcolored, make your
stamped ornament in tin as said, or
in irondest or copper, one ought not
to put a layer of glue here as on wood, but take only
fatty oil, which is made in seven or eight daysin
the sun with walnut oil and lead white&
with, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the oil thus made fatty, grind a little lead
white, massicot & mine de plomb, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
Minium gives color to the gold. Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the gold leaf on it with
cotton. Such gold will hold up in the rain on
houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with tinsel, color
it with fumée de perdrix or from yellow or red
cloth, & it will be beautiful like pure gold. You can
cover trunks, mirrors, canopies & posts of beds of colored
velvet or satin and then apply the gilded stamped ornament
on them with strong glue.


For coloring stamped trunks

The stamp of sheets of copper or latten is made on
service tree wood engraved
& cut should you want to spend less. And next, the stamped object is
colored with the aforesaid colours of lake, verdet,
azur d’esmail, & soak in turpentine varnish.
But in the place you want to azure, lay down fer
blanc, which is more appropriate for an azure
background.


Doublets

Good dragon's blood soaked in eau-de-vie
carries its mastic or glue in itself, so do
sap-green & saffron.


Fish glue or isinglassand
mouth glue

It is made from codfish skin, boiled rather than
being salted. Joinersglue their masterpieces
with it and guitar makers use it for delicate works.
It needs to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in barely boiling
water.

Mouth glue is made of parchment scrapings and
one uses it for glueingpaper or similar things without
fire, wetting it with one's mouth.


One beats it and soaks it in in eau-de-vieof

night, then one melts it over a slow fire. Others soak
it in eau-de-vie.

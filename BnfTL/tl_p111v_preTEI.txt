Water of sal ammoniac

The size of two chestnuts of pulverized
sal ammoniac suffices in a pot of water,
and to the tongue you find the water
moderately salty, for too much is not good.


Sanguine

To clean the various colors of lead & tin, one
pulverizes sanguine & with some cloths, one rubs the
e molded work.


Crab and crayfish



These are the hardest to mold & whoever molds them well will mold
many other very delicate things.


Lizards

When one takes them with two fingers from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
g mouth, then one takes the a
end of its lower mandible, with the end of the
fingernail, & after with the one from above
it bites the nail, but it cannot pass through, but it
bites very well. And if it were to bite living flesh it would
au not let go, & there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. In the spring, as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.



The small lizards that one takes in the summer, the
size of small female lizards, grey on the back & green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in silver, &
gold, or other metal, because their have rougher scales
than the of female lizards & show better.

Composition of sand

Everything once reheated as it said here above, take four 4 full
crucibles of plaster, two 2 of brick,
& one of alum de plume. Do not pass through the
sieve to mix, may because the
alum would not pass. Mix with your
hands, until neither one nor the other, neither white
nor red, is recognised among the other. If your plaster was not
strong, do not mix at all so much alum de plume, because
it softens the molds. Take head also that your sand is not hot
(since it has immediately been reheated) C when you
will want to mix it with water, for this les
makes molds too soft & breakable.





You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster if you do not
find it strong enough to withstand fire & if it cracks,
& in order that the part of crushed tiles holds up, with
the alum de plume, which you can also increase so that
it creates a better bond.

For casting

If you have some piece which does not want to release, & is big,
mold it with wax, either in cavity or in relief, because it is
malleable once soft & obeys, and thus separates itself from the
piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the melted wax
be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with wax heated in
hot water, but in pressing the mold, it becomes gauche
& becomes fake. Once your cavity in wax, you can cast in some
very soft clay & very moistened & clear, & let it dry
at ease. Then you will make a cavity on it ave of
lead or tin, in tu which what you will
form will be of good release.

& of gilt silver with which one makes the

Spinet playing by itself

attach quills as for a cittern or a spinet
& arrange them according to the song you want to be said, leaving
telle a suitable distance between. And, turning the

will be performed.

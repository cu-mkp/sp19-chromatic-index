Casting in silver and gold



Wanting to melt, always put for these two metals,
asmall stone of pulverized borax at the bottom of
the crucible & the gold and silver on top.
This makes it so that if the crucible renders some steam or
sour smoke, it will not impair these two metals. For
gold mainly, this is good.



If you have several molds to cast, do not think of filling them
in one cast, for the metal would be cold. But having cast while
hot & filling one, remelt & cast in the other. 

When your mold starts to redden on the inside, &
that the cast loses its blackness, then put your & that
looking inside the cast you you do not see
plasa single point of blackness,
continue to maintain it in this heat & if needs be, adjust it in
some half lit charcoals with your molletes. However,
com put in the forge your
crucible with a little ground borax at the bottom, &
the silver that you want to cast in your
forgeshould be on top. Let your
crucible reheat between the lit charcoals
juswithout blowing until it is red, for
before, one ought not to blow. And when you do blow, push in a long
& continuous movement the bellows, giving them a little
shake when pushing & another when pulling towards you. In this way,
the heat becomes stronger. ComNeTake heed to raise sometimes your
cruciblewith the with hot pincers, because
thatif it is placed right in front of the
tuelle & the bellow bwind builds the wind of the bellows hits
the crucible, it will cool your silver rather than
heating it. Make sure that the lit charcoals support it from above the
tuelle & take care that it is at a distance of
three good fingers from the wall of the
forge. In this way, it heats better. Therefore, when your
silver starts to melt, if you recognize that it is brittle,
seeing cracked & burst lumps, take the size of a
hazelnut of arsenic & two times as much of
raw tartar, coarsely pulverized, for in this way, they have more
ability to heat. And throw it sometimes in the crucible on the
silver, which clarifies it. But if you have some of that
sublimated crust on a metal substance, which looks like
grain of steel, as previously described, take a little
of that, leaving # the others & throw it
on your melted silver.



Some let the silver rest a little outside before casting.

Gold and silver, melted with the above said things, scarcely
become porous .



For gold, one does not need d as much
tincrocum as alum de
plume.



Small molds are reheated quickly, but big & small ones
should dry beforehand in the furnace, for the humidity of the
mold, by e fo the heat of the
furnace, is attracted outside. But the fierce heat of the
charcoals chases it from the exterior through the inside.



All alloyed silver makes chape, and all other
metal as well.

Silver does not want to be uncovered when melted.

#Coarsely pulverized



A lump of adulterated silver vitrifies in red because of the
arsenic & orpiment.

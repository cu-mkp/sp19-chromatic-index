The lake & floreerosette of
Ghent & others lose their color & die in the
air.

All marble on which a knife can prick is
worth nothing for grinding fine colors.

Chalk has no body in oil. Ceruse is
appropriate. But lead white more excellent. Ceruse is the
whitest, when ground first in water, the lead white
grayish. But the white it takes on its perfect whiteness in
oil.

When you grind your colors, first clean your workshop
well, for when walking, if you stir up dust, this will damage your
colors, which will never be beautiful if they are not very
be clean.

Florey must not be mixed with azur d'esmail
or another, for it makes it green.

For palettes to paint, ivory is excellent, knots
of the fir tree, the pear tree &, if it
is a walnut tree, make sure the grain of the wood
runs lengthwise.

L One always needs to prime
d on wood to paint there in oil in
order to fill the holes & unevenness, and prime with some stil de
grain yellow & ceruse mixed in oil, then soften
with a feather, which flattens better than a
pinceau. Or when the primer is dry, scrape strongly
with a knife.

To use azur dâ€™esmail in oil, one needs to
choose the most delicate. And to make it subtle, one ought not grind it,
for this makes it whiten. But one needs to wash it, & the roughest
going to the bottom, choose the one that is at the top of the
water or, by inclination, pour out the cloudy water, then
gather the azur.



@The one who makes his profession working in
oil will hardly work well in distemper if he has not
been trained well from adolescence. For the way of working is different,
because when washing the pinceau for distemper,
one always leaves it moist. And on the contrary, when one cleans the
pinceau in oil to soften, one wipes the
pinceau well. Otherwise, the work would run &
would soon be disfigured.



The Italians soften by hatching with a large flat
pinceau which makes serrations.



And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the Flemish,
but make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker
next & and finally a little blacker to better make recede & come
up.



In distemper do not mix your different colors together
But for this makes them die, but use each separately. And in
order that they do not dry & that you have time to soften, moisten
the back of the canvas.

Varnish for lutes

They take a little turpentine & oil of turpentine or
of spike lavender & amber pulverized &
passed very subtly & make as that of mastic, & add in to
color it a little dragon's blood and make it reddish,
and others some terra merita for yellow.


Borders of a garden

One needs to plow the soil, then make it thinner with the
rake. And next, if it is dry, one needs to moisten it. Then
stretch the chalked cord very close, and hit on the entire
length of the chalked cordas with the back
of a pruning knife, in order that the chalked cord
marks a straight line, the length of which you will un
bord make holes with an iron stake, where you
will plant your rosemary. Behead & cut to measure and
prune at the foot.


Locksmith

To well tin nails and other work, they file their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of fattiness, they
make it boil in vinegar, then they wipe it well with a
linen. Next they heat it & pass some
resin over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
varnish. This done, they melt some pure & fine tin in
their estamiere, which is a little square iron
box. And when the tin is well melted & moderately warm, they
throw in resin in to burn the filth, & then they let the
head of a nail or something similar soak a little, & having
remained there for seven or eight pauses, they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an iron to
make the tin that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a
small stick wrapped in tow. And if it is not well
tinned, you will hit it hot with a piece of resin & do
as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the tin is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the tin is too hot. Things t
thus tinned are durable & are not undone like tinning done
in leaf, thus at the end of a year they can be clarified
& renewed by heating & rubbing them.

Leadsmiths say that making a lizard die in the
melted il destin makes the tinning
become very golden. Or else putting in sal ammoniac.

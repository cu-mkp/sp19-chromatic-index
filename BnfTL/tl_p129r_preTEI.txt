Painting metal herbs

If you are in a hurry it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick gumor because oil takes a
long time to dry, and it runs if it is transparently layered,
as the herbs require. And if you still want it done quickly,
mix your color with glair beaten with fig tree
rind, and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
transparently.


For wormseed

 The pallid white of this herb is made from green verditer,
white lead or ceruse, a bit of massicot, stil de
grain yellow, and cendr√© d'azur. Mix & compose
your color according to a natural branch that you will have. 


Viper color



It is the most beautiful snake that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, & hard & transparent. Its true color
is made with good verdigris, well ground with some good
vinegar, if it is of lead or tin. And if it is in some
place darker, fumigate this first color with sulphur, as you
know. And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub
with coarse linen. The male, ejects from its
nature, which is at the bottom, when it is
firmly pressed, a little mass like a half ball of an arquebus,
made in the genitals and full of very venomous spurs.

+ Put a bit of metalline in your
tin & your lizard will resemble silver.


Molded roses



They are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine & weak
& doubled. But, to obl avoid this, one needs to
smear them with wheat oil, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms & stiffens the leaves to be able to separate
them & withstand the wet sand. The same is done with flies,
with pansies, & similar delicate things, with flowers from
the caper plant.

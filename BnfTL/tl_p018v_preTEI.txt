The average weighs 18 quintals &
measures xii pans long.
Its ball weighs eight or 9 lb & its charge is six
pounds of powder. And for At the breech it
carries a thickness of three balls, & in front, two. It is
more appropriate for the defense of a city than for battery.
However, one takes it sometimes either to break a barricade
or to support the battery after the cannons have shot, in order to
prevent the assailed from re-fortifying after the cannons have played or
shot. Four horses can draw it. It shoots at point blank eight
or nine hundred pas & almost as much as the
bastarde.



To cannons & large pieces one givesn as much
powder as is the diameter of a ball & a half, to
which dimension the escusson comes. To medium pieces, such as
field pieces, & smaller ones, one gives them powder the
thickness of two balls. To the passe-volant & other smaller
ones, one gives them powder the thickness of three
balls. In general, one charges all pieces up to the
escusson. One charges with the linstock all
pieces from the cannon to the piece of four quintalsde char, and one gives to them two
linstocks of cannon powder or one & a half
of arquebus powder. To smaller ones, one only gives them one
linstock, & those of one quintal are
charged with a small charge.



A field piece weighs ten or twelve quintals & is ten
pan long or 12. Its ball weighs vi or vii lb
& its charge is 4 lb of powder. At the breech it has
three balls & two in front, as do all pieces that are smaller than
the average. One gives them more of a breech because one makes them
longer in proportion, and also because in a house or
elsewhere one shoots them more frequently than the large pieces.
Their caliber is also small, which makes the breech 3 balls
thick. They are used for following a camp quickly & for the defense
of cities & houses, putting them on the
walls or on a tower. One needs three good
horses for drawing it.



The passe-volant weighs vi quintal, is eight or nine
pans long. Its ball weighs two lb, &, for
its charge, a lb & a half of powder. At the breech
it has three balls & two in the front. Two horses can move
it, for a single horse does not begin to move a piece. It is
used for the defense of houses, or for taking among the
infantry to break a rank of cavalry.



The faulconneau weighs 4 quintals, is x
pans long. Its ball weighs one lb & a
quarter, its charge is half a lb of powder. At the
breech three balls, at the front, two. To move it, two horses,
although such pieces are hardly moved insofar as they only serve to
defend houses. The ones which are carted around either for
battery or for siege combat, are cannons, culverines, medium-sized
bastardes & field pieces

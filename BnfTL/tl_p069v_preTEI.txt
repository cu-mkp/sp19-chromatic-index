The sand near my area is very excellent. But one ought
to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been
used. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is
lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
thickness, it is necessary that your substance of copper be very
hot so that it penetrates & runs. Some mix in lead with the
fonte, but it is for large works & not for small ones.

Sand from oxen feet twice-burned & finely ground
melts more neatly with copper, & without a chappe,
than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
f with a thickness as delicate as a knife
blade or a card. And being a hollow on one side, opposite the
relief which was on other side.

It is necessary that lean sands be more moistened than
others, namely with magistra or good pure wine or
boiled wine with elm tree roots & similar things.
But very fine sands, like burned linen which is fat &
soft on its own, want to be applied dry.

All moistened sand wants to be very beaten & stirred in order to
be ground finely \& to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
when it is bathed.

The olive oil that some mix in with beaten egg
white makes it become porous.

Sand of calcined glass withstands several castings, but there
are only the first ones. It also becomes porous.

Latten comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
good to mix it with a little copper, like a quarter
part, with the substance of skillets.

Founders cast well box molds up to 30 or 40 lb,
but not more.


It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for
releasing. Il because it crumbles. It is good that
it be alloyed with some fat thing which has bond such as molded
tripoly or abburned felt or sal
ammoniac or tripoly & similar things.

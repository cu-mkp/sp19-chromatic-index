Cleaning the bowl and the spoon with which one
wets the sand

Be careful to clean, as soon as & quickly after you have cast,
your bowl & your pallet or spoon with
which you wet your sand, because â€™il if it dries in
them, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or
a fault in the work. When also the mold is reheated, these
little pieces crust up & flake off & prevent neat
casting.


Molding hollow

Wax on its own cools too quickly & does not run well
everywhere, & tallow keeps well its heat & runs
everywhere, but on its own it is not good. But when wax &
tallow are mixed, the work is only better. Crayfish &
other small animals can easily be molded hollow for the body, but as for
the legs, it will be troublesome.



The first part of the mold, that is the first cast on the
slab of clay, cracks more readily in the fire than the
second.


Molding medals and flat things

You are not bound to making the gate for legs thus



, but rather in this way



, which embraces the medal well. For the other way with legs is only
done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is
wide and in one piece, works better for flat medals. But take heed
that all gates be very thin close to the medal & almost not as thick
as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from
the medal towards the gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes better
thus. If the gate is thick, at the entry to the medal, the work will
never come out well. Make that, desp from the middle
of the gate to the top it is moderately thick, & from the same
middle to the bottom very thin. Do not forget to makes grooves at
au hau the top of the gate to prevent that the
metal runs furiously.

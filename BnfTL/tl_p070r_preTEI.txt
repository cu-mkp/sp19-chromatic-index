When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the smoke of
the substance you are melting, because the cast absorbs the quality
oef the metal, which runs
afterwards more easily in something that comes from it.

Human bones are the best for casting once
calcined.

To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot
& to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some
iron scales, or in powder or otherwise E, for
it heats copper a lot & cleanses it of its fat. At the
end, when you want to cast, add some saltpeter, by folding your
additions in a paper in order that everyone may not know what you
are adding.

Sheep foot bones are even better than ox
foot bones.

Oil & tallow make it really porous &
crushed glass & copper alone.

Cendr√©e earth molds very neatly.

Ashes do not have enough body to withstand
copper.

It is best not to mix the sands, but fill the box mold with
one only.

Latten is always fat, & does not mold neatly. One finds
that it comes out better alloyed with a quarter of
copper, but it needs to be cast very hot.

Copper comes out well with a bit of metal. If you mix
in metal within latten, it will be more brittle & more
troublesome.

A slightly coarser sand has more body.

Sand from corp rock is always better,
which seems like tuf in lumps, which has a beautiful
& very fine grain, & a little fat. One pestles it, then one
dries it in a skillet on the fire, until it is stops
smoking, then one passes it through through a double sieve
& fine, & one molds with it.

Copper or latten cannot come out well if the medal does
not sufficient thickness, & if it does not have it, give it some
with some wax.


Some cast through a hole made in the middle of the reverse side of the
medal.


Some wanting to cast large works in latteny
mix in the sand some crushed glass to give the earth some
bond. But it makes it porous, and needs to be repaired.


One puts in lead for a large work to make it run, but not
not


for in a small one because it would leave filth all around
the work.

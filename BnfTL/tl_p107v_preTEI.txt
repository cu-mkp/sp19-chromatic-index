Molds can only be used once for
fine things, like wormwood & others, one needs to break
them, but before one needs to dip them well into water in which
the twice reheated things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be
able f to release your work without danger of
spoiling it.

Good alum de
plume is white and as lustrous
aswhite c silk. It is in pieces
long as a finger, & is very breakable & wooly
as down. The one made of stone is harder & not so
good. Il The best of the above mentioned quality is
brought in France near Rouan. The alum de
plume for our sand is pestled in a mortar, and is
ground further on the marble, especially since one
cannot think of passing it finely through the sieve, for it is
so fat & wooly, that it would not pass through it. It is this, with
its small soft qui & thin filaments, which gives
binding to the sand, in a much more excellent fashion than
tondure in the founderâ€™s earth of the founders
of great works, because this tondure &
cloth waste burns and alum de plume resists the
fire.

To enclose the molds, when you em throw
onto the things to mold your liquid sand, make your a circle
& surround with well beaten fat
earth.

Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria,


v{idelicet} res exprimenda formis, sive herba sit sive
animal


ut lucerta, inafinting
inmergatur primum in vini spiritum


aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur


sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut


assolet).

When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the
noyau be of the same substance. And if the snake or
the animal is curved or folded, one ought to make the noyau of
several pieces.

Try to see if distilled vinegar is
appropriate for eating away & dissolving what will be in the animal
molded hollow.


If you know that your plaster is not strong enough to withstand
the fire without breaking, do not be so scrupulous an observer of the
mixture put here that sometimes you mecties would
not diminish the quantity of alum de plumeld a little bit, for it softens the
molds with its sweetness. Once reheated do not pulverise it, on
this occasion, as fine as said, but leave it as the
apothecaries have ground it, for it does not hinder the
neatness of the cast & gives more binding. When the sand
mold, estant having set, retains the color
brick, and is reddish, it is firmer.

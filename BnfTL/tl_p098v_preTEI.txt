Small dogs

Small dogs who should be shaggy are known by this, that
they have a larger muzzle than others.


Salted artichokes

One puts them whole & not too ripe in a firkin that one
fills with brine. Then one serves them all
year, among salads, raw with oil & vinegar,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your brine with an egg for if it is good & and strong
enough, the egg will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the fruits.


Trees

Which bear fruits quickly are aged and scarcely last.


Birds

Which have been fed by the rod do not whistle among the
company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them
well to whistle, one needs to take them from the nest before they can
see & cover them with down or a hare skin. Thus,
having not seen their father and known his voice, they learn the whistle
that one teaches them better.


Fonte

The pot√©e is made of burnt earth which was
used in the fonte, this is earth bourre bolvene
in which one has melted it. One grinds it on a big
stone, & with this one one makes the
chappe of first coat of the chappe of
bells, where there are letters & works, & le
only needs to be reheated in the flame of a straw, and mold very
neatly.

The earth which molds in noyau is subject to making
it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush or your
finger on the molded piece, which should be well
oiled. And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.

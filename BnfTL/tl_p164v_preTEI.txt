Molds



For those which in which one needs to burn something, and
which do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts
before it is reheated. For large molds in which the gate is big
and ample, it is necessary that the gate be well notched &
scratched, in order that the weight of the metal does not go with
much force. They make hardly any fins if they are pressed. But before
pressing them, put between them and the press some pieces
of thick & moufl√© felt, which is hardly yet
crushed, for it fills the concavities & keeps the mold from
breaking. The clamps should be placed before reheating or
drying it.



When the earth, from which you make the earth
slab to arrange your animal, is too soft, the points that
you put in it come out easily & come undone when you thrown in the
sand & thus the mold spoils and the shape comes undone.
Therefore when you recognise that your slab is too tender &
soft, spread on top some hot ashes & blow with
bellows.


Sable



If there is not enough good alum de plume or
crocum, it will easily break in the fire. But if it is
mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. One recognizes it as
good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water
when one quenches it in it, & rends breaks
easily because the alum & the crocum render
it spongy. Contrarily, bad sand, which is only of plaster &
brick, & little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the
fire & hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one
go.


Molds



Even though you cast in lead, the molds want to be well
dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on
the outside & keep them in continuous heat, until they no longer
smoke from inside. Do not place them to reheat at different
moments, but continue once you have started. And do not place them
to cool in the cold, with for they would break,
but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, & when they are
when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before putting
your finger in the hole, cast. And when the
mold is large, it needs more time to reheat & dry & one
needs to cast hotter.

For gacachcages

You can embellish them with thin enamel canes of
various colors by covering the latten or iron wire with the said
thin canes. These you will break neatly to the length that you
want if you slightly notch with a cutting file at the place to
be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
them with a wood model over a
chafing-dish or else by the heat of the lamp. It can
also be drawn as long as you want in a small furnace made like
a reverberatory furnace but which is pierced on both sides. And
when the big thin cane is red, they seize the hot end using
small pincers with a long beak, such that one prong of the beak
of the small pincers enters inside the end of the thin
cane, & thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &
the other end of the thin cane is held with the hand,
because it is not hot. When the thin cane is stretched enough,
the one who works seated, having his small furnace,
the size of a carnation pot, before him,
breaks it off & continues. This is for making thin
canes for capes, which are cut as already mentioned, and with a
file. Glass-button makers also avail themselves of
the said furnace.



Under the door is a grill that supports the lit charcoal, &
the ash is emptied by turning the furnace upside
down.

Etch with aquafortis on iron or copper
whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat with a
burin or chisel. Then pour doulx tin,
yet unused, onto polished marble & flatten it,
making it quite thin, with a wooden board. Or else pour
it on a table as is done with lead, or put it through a
roll-press. Next lay your tin plate over the engraving,
& over the tin plate put a piece of felt and
strike it with a hammer. Then gild it in the following
manner.

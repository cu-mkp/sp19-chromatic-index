Reheating molds

The frames readily dry out & do not reheat. For
reheating is actually for the second time to redden &
inflame the molds in the fire, and drying out is to let the
molds dry themselves, or to make their dampness evaporate by
placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one.
Noyau molds readily reheat & frame molds
dry out.


Latten smoke



It is good to reheat in it the molds for casting latten,
for this gcyellow filth, which
appears nevertheless to refill the molds, casts very neatly,
being of the same nature.


For red copper

When it is melted, it is good to throw in a little fine tin,
for this makes it run.


Clay earth

This one, moistened & well beaten & kneaded as you know, is
necessary for you to make the contour for containing your
molds. But take heed that it not be too soft, but rather as if
half dry, that ielle it does
not attach to your hands, because otherwise
it would attach to your work. Always keep it in a damp place,
and make holes in it, and fill them with water, to keep it
fresh.


The gray one is best, which does not crack at all.


It is more appropriate than a blade of lead.




Iron wire

You need to have enough provisions of different thicknesses,
according to the molds that you want to make, some large
like cord, some  & some thin p,
like the large cords of a spinet, for small works. You
make, once de reheated, clamps from it to close the
molds & the points, like needles of different lengths,
according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded & keep it
subjected. Needles would not be good for this because it is
necessary that their points be empty & of the same thickness
throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as
you have need of. Iron wire is firmer than that of
latten.

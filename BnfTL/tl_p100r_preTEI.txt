Gold color

To quickly make a layer of or sur
mat on canvas or other oil panel, one makes fatty
walnut oilin the sun or on the
fire, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither lead, nor ceruse. And with this,
grind massicot, mine, & other desiccatives,
not verdet nor orpiment, for they cause the
gold to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
weather is not clear & dry, do not shade it,
for if the weather is damp & humid, it would
turn black.


Portrait-painting from nature

One needs to carefully observe the eyes, the nose, &
the beard, for these three things make strong resemblance.


Gemstones

You need to pestle your materials in a mortar of
thick glass,& encased & stuck with mastic
into another mortar of wood in order that it does not
break, this can serve for perfumers, & la
t the pestle also of glass.


Mortar of glass and
slab of glass for grinding.

Vitrified saltpeter



Being melted with pebbles, it makes the glass very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a hot tile or coal
shovel. And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it as
much of the white calcined pebbles. It is true that, in the
little furnace, it is not clarified well. But for large
glass, it makes the glass very clear & white &
clean.


Windows through which the sun will not pass

Take the aforementioned calcined saltpeter & expose it to
a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a
liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the
sun will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the saltpeter on some clean thingplace, & it put glowing coals on it,
and continue all over until it no longer burns.



It also serves for melting & for adding in with alkali salt
for cleaning hands.

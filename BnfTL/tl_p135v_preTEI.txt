Casting in ☼

Take a crucible with a capacity suitable for what you want
to put in it, pestle a little borax coarsely & put it at the
bottom, then the ☼ on top. Arrange on the
charcoals of the forge the crucible in such a
way that the wind of the bellows blows on it from underneath
and not at the side, for this cools it & does not heat it enough.
Make sure also that it is distanced three fingers from
the wall of the forge, in order that it can be surrounded with
charcoal. Let the said crucible reheat, until it is well
red. Then, make your boy blow on it with long and strong
pushes, for in this way it heats well better. And
nevertheless blow by when the gold is melted, blow on
top with a little bellows, for the gold will become
brittle & take on a chappe. And as long as it makes a
swirling smoke, as you blow thusly, it means that is not doulx
enough for the cast. Uncover therefore the crucible &
without moving ch it from its place and without
interrupting the blowing, make it lean towards you in order to see well
inside. Throw in it the size of a bean of borax
& blow inside in jolts with the little bellows. But if
there is charcoal inside, blow a little stronger to make it go
out. And if the gold smokes & swirls, put some more
borax in and note blow on top, making sure that, if it
is still brittle & not softened enough, it does not cover itself
when you blow, as if it had cooled. But if it does not make this sign,
it is douls enough. @At that point blow very strongly in order
to heat it well, and as you think it is hot enough, throw in on top, in
the crucible, thecouleur
composed, as said beforehand here, of verdet, saltpeter,
sal ammoniac & borax, a little. And
let rest blow always with the small bellows, and the
gold will become shiny like


If you cast in gold some important piece, lute your
mold with the same sand where there is there is some
crocum.


If you want to cast some large work in gold, or which is
important, make at the foot of the forge, or at one end of it a
four à vent, where you can hold your
mold in the completely n red sand. 


One can cast two or three lb of gold.

Sal ammoniac and iron dross

I have pulverized sal ammoniac, well dried in the fire &
in a hot bronze mortar, and passed it through the
double sieve, it became very fine. But to render it even
thinner, I have crushed it dry on porphyry. Then I mixed
it with pulverized & finely ground iron dross, in the same
way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief, without being
moistened in the serain, or in the
cellar, or otherwise with the napkin, & it
releases very neatly.


Sand

Molders from Foix who cast their medals from the
side, use crocum ferri and calcined slate. It is
for very flat things.


All sands can be rendered good

Artisans who work in big works, & who need to further
their profit, by seeking things already prepared in nature, because it
does not sell its wares to people, and to also save the time they would
use for grinding finely & for artificially preparing sands, seek
the one of the smines,
which is not too fat, having some earth in it, not too lean &
consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled from the
depths of the sand-bed in mattons & clods that show
its natural compactness, which is quite difficult to break & which
has a very small & delicate grain, & which is found soft
when handling it between your fingers. And
because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous
areas, or lean territories & having
arene, it cannot be found inin the
surroundings of all the bonnes villes, where
artisans willingly gather themselves. And thus, if they do
not have it close to their house, they prefer to have it come
from afar, like from Lyon, Venise, Parys near the
Sainct Chappelle & similar places, rather than prepare it.
However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the
sand from a quarry.

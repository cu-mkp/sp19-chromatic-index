Founder

The mold of earth is reheated until sometimes it
becomes red hot, for otherwise the metal would spatter &
would not do anything good. And similarly, the noyau on the
inside should be very reheated, & mixed with charcoal
powder.


Wax for seal and imprint

For the large wax seals, one needs to have tepid water
always ready & apre to keep your wax in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your hands
to render it very even, for otherwise the water that would get in
between would prevent it from coming together. Next you will imprint
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of paper on, &
with a stickyou even & round like a
pestle, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the paper, which will help you lift it off
the mold. Thus you will imprint better than if you dripped it
molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, &
paint them with colors in varnish, & transfer them onto a
base of glass painted with colors in turpentine &
mastic. And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it
with gum ammoniac  mixed with vinegar, and you will have
good glue.


For casting in plaster

Melt some wax, & with a large brush, coat the
relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust upon which qu will be formed,
upon which you will cast youplaster, to give it body
and strength. Next, in the wax cavity, you will also cast your
plaster in order to have your relief, & it will come out very
easily, thanks to the wax. This is done more often for large
pieces in high relief than for others.

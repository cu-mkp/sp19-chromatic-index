Perfume maker

They readily put half of amber & half
of musk, & a very little civet, because amber
always overtakes the principal scent of musk.

To spare the amber, they readily put a little musk in
the white layers & pour l which gives a more
severe scent. But to remove la or hide the
blackness of the musk, they put in a little of wheat
starch from England, which is perfectly white.

When the amberTo make a perfume of white
amber in the fashion of those in Portugal, take a
huchau of amber well broken up. And having put in a
small silver bowl a silverspoonful of flower oil, or lacking that,
Ben oil, that is to say, a silver
spoon that one uses at the table, put in your
ambergris & place all on a low fire, and it will melt quickly
if your amber is good, & it will remain there without lumps.
Once all melted, put in the amount of a pinon of
civet, & make it melt & mix it well together. Next take
your gloves, well-cleaned & well-dried, & dipping the
tip of your finger very lightly on on the
edge of the oil, spread it on the glove little by little
& with patience & rub the glove between your
hands, & trace the fingers & the stitches, one after
the other. And leave it to dry. Next trace again as before until the
amber is all laid down.


Eau-de-vie

It is excellent for molding neatly, such that in the place where you
do not put any, the sand will usually attack the figure. But it needs to
be in three passes. And because it does not take easily on oiled
things, I believe that it would be good to put some amongst the
water in which you wet your sand.

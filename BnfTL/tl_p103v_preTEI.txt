Enema



In order that the tube does not harm, for example children, or those who
se have protruding or swollen hemorrhoidal
veins, one covers the end of the tube with a piece of
chicken gut & one folds it back over the end, &
in this way, one gives the enema.


Cast

Tin retracts once thick, thusly it is best to cast it thin &
to make two pieces out of one, then solderthem if
needs be. One uses a strong piece of taffeta to sieve the fine
sand, with which one first covers the medal, the thickness of a
teston.


For making colors run



Mix vinegarwith a little with bile, & put
it p into a glass bottle, & if
you want to keep it for a long time, add some salt to it & of
this mix some of it among your colors & that will make them
run.


Earwax



If you take enough with the tip of an ear picker &
you pass it through the foam of urine, which is readily made by
those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.


Enamels



For recognizing well their difference and their true color by
candle, you need to put your candle behind a
crystal mirror, or a glass globe or jar
full of water, because this light is like
sunlight.

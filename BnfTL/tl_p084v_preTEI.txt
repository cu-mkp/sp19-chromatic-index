Sand

I tried the bone of oxen feet, very burned &
pulverized & ground on porphyry, until it is
not felt between your fingers. It molds on its
own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid & lean, it
wants to be well moistened & dampened with wine boiled with
elm root.

Iron dross, well burned bone of oxen feet,
felt also well burned over a closed fire, and all three very well
ground on porphyry mold very neatly in lead,
without needing to be reheated a lot, & casting
lein a hot or cold frame.

Felt alone molds very neatly once moistened & releases
well, and also makes the other two release.


These sands only withstand one casting.


A fat sand which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.


A fat metal needs lean sand.



Eau Magistra

Some people think that salt water is not good, because the
salt cracks in fire, & consequently should make it porous. a
result causes bubbles. There is only wine boiled with elm
root.

Charcoal for poncer makes for a good release, but
one finds the one of willow make it porous. The one
of oak or beech does well without making it
porous.


Try burnt oysters.


Lead

For casting, there is only soft lead that wants to be cast
very g hot, and soft tin.


Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low
reliefs

 I took ceruse and crushed it dry on
porphyry, to make it very fine, then I moistened so
much, with well-beaten glair of egg, that it was like a paste,
smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a knife. I left it
a little. 




One ought to mix it well with a knife.

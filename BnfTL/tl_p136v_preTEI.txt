For casting with latten

The latten from skillets, where one makes the mush for
little children, which is doulx, is appropriate for
the cast. Some say that German tokensare
contain a lot of calamine. However, as they are thin, the
calamine exhales out when melting them, as it does in
all meta remelted latten, which through melting
again returns red. However, fresh calamine & on its own, put
again on melted latten, makes it run & cast neatly, because
the one that is in the remelted delatten is
half corrupted in its natural state, & makes it become porous &
blusters because it is disposed to exhaling. Therefore use
calamine alone, on its own, very recent, on the melted
latten. Take heed to cast very hot & that your mold
be red like for gold, silver, copper &
metal. If you cast with recent calamine, keep yourself
away from the smoke, for it is pernicious. I wanted to use
German tokens to cast medals & took thirty & xii
nails of rosette, like for chairs, which are of
doulx latten. This substance, containing a lot of
calamine, like all strong yellow latten, strongly smoked,
which is what prevents latten from running and makes it
porous. Make many vents & cast very hot, that your
latten is white like water or melted silver &
similar to a very polished steel mirror. The second fusion comes
out better, because there is exhaled calamine and does not make
as much smoke. If it is in a frame, which does not break
& withstands a, the second cast comes out neat,
because it is imbued with calamine smoke, which embraces &
receives the second one. Sal ammoniac alone, put in
latten, renders it neat & shiny. Huile
tingente even more so. It does not need any sand other than the
previous in noyau & that the mold be red like for
gold. Make many vents. And if you cast yellowed latten
with the prepared tutty, you will not have any bad smoke.




This metal is very fanciful to cast, because of the calamine
smoke, and one ought not leave it pass rest even
a little bit outside the fire, like some do with silver, for it
is immediately cold when it feels the air and the
wind. It always leaves some type of tail, like glass, when
you cast it. Casters do not usually take that very yellow
latten, because of the calamine passed through the fire. But
when wanting to cast red copper, they yellow it either with
fresh calamine, or with prepared tutty. Wanting to cast,
one purifies it well of charcoal, with a stalk of
copper or iron, and one covers it with a
cloth, soaked in pig fat, mixed with
saltpeter or sal ammoniac to keep it from
the wind & from cooling.

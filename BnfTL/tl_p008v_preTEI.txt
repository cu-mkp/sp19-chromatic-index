Polishing of the balas ruby

It is not polished with tripolibut like the
others, but with marcasite powder & oil.


Or et argent moulu

You need to calcine your fine gold with
☿ and then wipe your amalgam well & make the
said mercury fly off. Next grind it on marble
with gum water. As for silver one needs to take it as
is & eat away at it with aqua
fortis, then take it out with a copper blade
& rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with gum water.


Polishing of stones

There are three wheels for doing this, one of tin, one of
lead, & one of fine copper, on the
cucopper wheel one does not
commonly cut co or polish but the diamond,
the ruby, sapphire, & oriental jacinth. The
tin wheel is for more tender stones like emerald,
amethyst, & others.


Mixture of Pewterers

Because among the fine tin they often mix well half
of lead, which renders the tindeaf. To correct
this, they mix in some latten filings to render it
sonorous.


Perfect amalgam

Take the most delicate stoneware you can, with a cavity in
the middle. Put in an eighth part of ☿in & while adding water, rub & wear down your
☾ or ☼ until the
substance becomes like paste & even harder. Next, if you want, eat
it away with good aquafortis, if it is
☾ or ♀. Then remelt it,
having taken it out as you know. The ☾ will be
colored, and having been melted, will leave some grains of
☼, & the ♀ will be
very fine & will have almost no chappe.

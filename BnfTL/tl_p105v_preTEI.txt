Next, when it will be well b taken, cut the top
of the tree that exceeds your tree, ne three or 4
fingers above the shield for the first time, and
apr then, at the closest point, in order that is
closed. But heed well that when you will make your shield no small hole
remains at the back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that
its root would be broken, & your graft would never take; but make it
so that the back is intact. This type of grafting is practiced
from mid-May, so that the trees have already budded
& made new output, until the beginning of
August, and so that the trees are in sap. Almond
trees, which are naturally drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore
those who want to graft onto them mericotons,
apricots & grafts of trees with pitted fruit, which are the
best there, they are grafted in the month of
January. Generally trees with pitted fruit, like
mericoton peaches, are grafted in clefts. One says
that trees de grafted en piolet or
escusson are later to bear fruit than those en
fente.


Gardening

It would not be very scrupulous to cultivate in one's
gardenarmols, because, when soup &
broth is kept a little bit cold, it creates worms in it.


Fountain maker

As you will see below in the discussion of the
mold-maker, reheated plaster immediately mixed into
water, & and put on the joints of the conduits of fountains,
s resists as much as any stucco.


Catching nightingalesSee the 15th folio after
this.

For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that
they like the best, & the season of their pleasure. The
nightingale, as long as it sings, maintains a territory for
itself alone. Therefore approach making as if searching the ground for
something. And taking some worms which come from old meal or
from beneath mects Ã  petrir or mills, which the
nightingale is fond of, put some on your hat attached
with a pin or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five
or six steps from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the
ground & put in some worms and your device of little
crossed sticks. It will be anxious for you to leave so it can go
see what you have done, and seeing worms it will enter.

Some sell nightingales on
trees.

The coolness of the evening
and the morning, near fountains & shaded places, are
more appropriate for taking them.


Nightingale

It is necessary that the iron wire of its cage be the
thickest possible, in order that, thinking of leaving, it will not be
hurt. Cover, from the moment that it is taken, its cage with
canvas. One needs to force feed it the first
day, giving it taking it out from its
cage into the hand & opening its beak, & with a
small wooden pin, put it in its throat & make it
swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer opinionated. This is
done for sustaining it, for if it would become thin it would die.


Nightingale

It is necessary for him to have a cage made in the barn,
like those for calendras, doubled with green cloth,
because he fears the cold. And for making him accustomed to
eating when first he is put in the cage, one needs to give him
ants with soil at the bottom of the cage to
make it accustomed to pecking puys luy, and give him
chopped sheep's heart, & immediately some
eggs, & mealworms.

Modelling in wax

When wax is too hard, one mixes in turpentine or a
little butter, which sont pl renders the
wax more amiable, and more appropriate than the tallow
that the Italians put in, because one has to, often, put the
tools in the mouth, which are better in box
wood or bone of hart.


Wax for molding -

As the wax is melted, they have sulphur that is
melted, in a spoon or crucible, & they pour some
in the melted wax. And the sulphur going to the bottom or
remaining on top, it leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the
wax, & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the mold gently, like butter, without leaving
any gently melts in the mold like butter, without
leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be warned to not give it too

Smear well, very lightly, with oil, so little that it hardly

with lukewarm water so that it does not repel the
oil.


Bellows of the forge

It is best that they be fixed in on some piece of
membreure, through the portevent,
q for they are more secure, next you can lightly
secure them from above. It is necessary that the tuelle be 4
fingers on the sole of the forge.


Snakes for molding

When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums & mouth, & can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a barrel full of bran or even better of
earth, in a cool place, or in a glass
bottle. And give them some live frog or other live animal
for they eat nothing dead. Also I have noticed that

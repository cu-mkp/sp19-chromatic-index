Earth, or sand, moistened or ground with water, wants
to be reheated more than sand.

Latten from a candlestick is not pure, for one mixes in it
iron filings & potin.

Latten wants to be cast hotter than copper, quod
non credo.

One ought not, to cast carefully, to take metals already
alloyed, but take them pure & mix them.

Iron hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of
copper or latten.

It is better all with a sand, either in a frame or
noyau at once, rather than several mixed.



One ought to reheat for one or two hourset
p, in thatacharcoal fire which
lights by itself, a crucible with the substance inside, and
then blow & cover the crucible with large charcoals
& the mouth of the furnace with bricks, and
let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal, which
se fill the furnace above the
crucible. In the end feed and stoke the fire, & when the
flame is very white & that the substance will be in a liquid
bain like water & casting off pale blue flames,
cast. The secret is to cast very hot & in one go.


Lean white sand

Without bond renders well proper for casting, & having body, if
you grind it very finely on porphyry or calcine it,
reddening it several times in the fire, & spread it in
vinegar or finely grind it with water, as you know. It
also molds very neatly in noyau, as I have experimented. But do
not moisten it with salt water if you want to quickly reheat it,
for salt boils on the fire & makes pustules, being pressed by
the fire. I believe that the noyau, gently reheated, would not
do this. I molded very neatly in noyau the substance of
skillets. White sandsmells like sulphur when
reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
cast in it, it acquires in the moldco{mm}e a luster as if it were
leaded or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers could
use it.



One needs very little of sal ammoniac dissolved in
water.


Bell handles



They can be put back on, without remaking the bell, which one ought to
put back in the pit, & and mold it there. But should you
solder a ref cracked bell, it is considered
impossible to give it its first voice.

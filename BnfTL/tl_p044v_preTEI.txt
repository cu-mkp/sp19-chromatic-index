Horsehair sieves

They are made at Coustance in Normandy with
horsetail hair which they clean with lye because
they sort them with the mouth & separate out short
& broken ones. They do not make the reed longer than the
sieve, & the reed is round. They attach to both edges of
the reed the hair, either black or white, according to
the work they want to make. And the weft is is
done over & under as for making any other fabric. And passing a
small flat stick of ii or three fingers wide
between two, next they pass two hairs at each step of the pedal
and weave with three pedals. There are xviic hairs in the entire
sieve. They sell them by the dozen & each dozen
xxx sols. They bring them to Toulouse to
transport them afterwards to Spain, and take silk tammy
in exchange for it .


Excellent water against the pest by Monsieur de
Montorsin

Take some theriac, rue &
dittany, & good vinegar, put the whole in a
glass bottle, leave it half-open & well fixed, and
put it in a very long bath for three or 4 days. Then
separate your decoction from the residue, of which decoction in time of
need you will pour some, on a flaming red tile & receive
the vapor of it & also perfume your clothes with it. This is a very
rare & tested secret.


White soporific oil

Take x or 12 mandrake apples, put them in quarters
in olive oil, the whole in a vialglass bottle which you will place in a bain marie for
two days and your oil will turn white. If you
rub the sole of your feet with the same, you will soon feel
like sleeping.


Stucco

For glueingstone, some do not use
poiresin & black pitch resin
because it is too fatty, but take rosin & sulphur,
as much as of one as the other, & as much of

wax as the two, and mix it with crushed brick for greater
strength. Others, white chalk or crushed & pulverized
& sieved white stone.

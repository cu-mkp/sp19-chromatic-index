Snails

Those which are found in the sea & similarly those in
which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for
grottos, if they are stripped of the first crust of their
shell with aquafortis, for they truly appear to be made of
mother-of-pearl.


For removing flaws and flashing from things molded en
noyau

If your molds are of good plaster which withstands
well the fire &, they will not crack at all, especially
if, with presses, they are well squeezed well between two
tablets or in a vessel filled with ashes or
sand, & in this way they will make any flaws. But if they do
make some, you can remove them with a burin that one calls
chaple, which has a tip like a small
chisel.


For grottos


The old vine stocks

Stones made from water called stuf;
charcoal; the compound of tin & fine latten; paper
pestled & mixed with pestled glass; cork;
heated parchment; white coral are appropriate for making
grottos. But fantastical pieces of wood which are
found in the forests & mushrooms and
potirons of trees, once dry, are better than
any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
looking-glass tin which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles in
a different kind of marcasite which one washes to cleanse them of
earth, &one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
beautiful. If there is no fountain in the grotto, one
glues all al of this with colle
forte, which and it is soon done. Take
specimens of all kinds of mines. The sulfurous marcasites,
which do not have a grain but are even like looking-glass tin,
are very beautiful.

Rosette is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the hammer, which are very
beautiful pulverized on grottos.


Looking-glass tin

It whitens & renders firm fine tin if en
on one puts in in one ounce of it, that
is to say, i â„¥ of looking-glass tin in
one lb of fine tin.


Sal ammoniac

ItSal ammoniac water is very natural for casting
in gold & in silver.

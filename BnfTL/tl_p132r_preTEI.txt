to not open your mold too hot, for this sours it, makes it
porous & contracts the tin & makes the molded thing
break. Also, do not quench your hot mold in water, for
this makes the le mettin or lead
contract.


Mold made in two casts

It opens once reheated to be cleaned, next, one puts the
clamps on again, one lutes the mold &
especially the joints, then one slowly dries the earth. And then,
as it no longer smokes, one leaves the mold to cool until you
hold it without harm. Next, put in the presses or in the sand
in a terrine, & cast in tin. For if you
were to cast in silver or gold, it would be necessary that
your mold be reheated twice & cast, as it would be
red.


If your moldf, through the fault of the
plaster, retracts in the fire, one needs to open it,
after the first reheating, to tighten it again & clamp it
and lute again and tighten again. 


Method for reheating the molds

Light charcoals in the forge, & then arrange
them in rows in a corner of it, according to the size of your
mold, in such a way that it can be furnished with three or 4
fingers all around, and especially at the bottom of
the mold, which is the thickest, and which. Your
charcoals thus arranged, place your molds on top of
them, & not on a grille, as some do, because they
would take the fire too harshly. And leave for some time thusly, &
little & by little warm your oven, always adding some lit
charcoal. And as long as the mold is damp, the
charcoals will be as if died down from below. But as it dries,
they will light themselves. And when it is dry on one side, turn it to
the other. And when it is dry on both, & it no longer smokes. At
that moment, invigorate the fire & cover it with lit
charcoals. And as it begins to redden, do not blow the
charcoals with a little bellows, for this would make it
blow burst. And similarly, when it is red, keep it well
covered with lit charcoals & do not uncover it, for it would
break. Make sure wind from a window does not beat on it. Let
cool


When you want to reheat your molds, & be they
luted or not, mark the place on the belly to put it under,
against the lit charcoalsque because if the
ardor of the fire would make them crack, it would be better that this be
at the belly & from underneath, than on the back.


@If your mold is small, one ought not to leave it
rest so much in the fire, for it corrupts and breaks there,
for it reheats more quickly than a big one.

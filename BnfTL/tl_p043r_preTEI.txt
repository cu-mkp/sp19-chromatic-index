Mericotons and pavis

One should graft them en during Advent of
Christmas as long as they do not freeze too much.


White bronzing on plaster

One needs to give four layers of painters' glue in
distemper on the plaster portrait, always leaving each layer to
dry. Next, with mine d’Angleterre ground on a marble, or
burnt lead, grind av & distemper with a bit of
gum or goglue, lay down lightly. Once
dry, rub lightly with a little cotton and the plaster
portrait will seem to be of lead. Others grind minium with
quicksilver.


Purpurine

The soft tin, half an ounce of, melt it in a
spoon. Once melted, throw in an ℥ of ☿, mix
together. Once cold, grind on porphyry. Next take an ℥
of sal ammoniac, an ℥ of sulfur, the yellowest
that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the
aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a a
pignattaglass sublimatorium, hold this over
a small fire for an hour & for an
hour over a stronger one & for an
hour over a very strong fire, and it will be done.
Next, to use it, apply soot black with the glue that
painters use to paint, & two or three times,
until it is quite black. Next apply a little varnish. Once dry,
apply the purpurine a secco with a finger where
you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if
you want, apply varnish on top.


White bronzing

Apply black with glue, as was said, on the medal, then
varnish. Once dry, grate mine
d'Angleterre on top with a pinceau
or a finger. The said grated mine
embellishes lead medals.

Crayfish

The hairy cornicles that it has under its beak
coe tend to come out lumpy & not neat because,
being burnt, it is difficult to remove them & clean their
ash, which, staying in the mold, it prevents
the metal from running well therein; & for that reason, one
makes a small gate of wax thread at the tips of them, both to
hold them up and to blow out the clogging ash.



Spare no pins, placing them not only in the middle of the body,
but also on the big legs, and two or three at the tail, according to the
stance that you want to give it.


Crocum

That which is rusty by itself, being showered with salt water
or vinegar or urine, and then very
dried out and reddened in fire, is very red ground on
porphyry and is of the color of Levant
bole, & approaching minium. But that which is showered
with urine & dried out acquires a deeper tincture
& approaches crushed aes ustum or vermillion.
But the first one, finely ground, acquires a bright red color, in
the like cinnabar, in eau-de-vie. And the ones and
the others, prepared as said, and finely ground & rendered very hot,
give off a red smoke like a volatile spirit if, being thus hot
and fine, one throws on top vinegar, urine, or
eau-de-vie. Urine gives much tincture, and
eau-de-vie also.


Repairing

It is better to repair little with the burin called
onglet, or with that which one calls
chaple, or some small file. But above all,
avoid touching your work, but only the fin or lump that will have
occurred during the cast. And while repairing, wet & rub with your
small piglet-bristle brushes.

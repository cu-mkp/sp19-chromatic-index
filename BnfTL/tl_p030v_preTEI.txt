any dish or plate, they loosen & undo with the strike of a
hammer the iron wedges that slide along the spokes of
the wheel. And, when they are at the notch and points that they
need, they tighten the said wedges, striking them with the
hammer.

When their plates or dishes have been cast, soldered if needed,
& recleansed of surrounding froth with the hot soldering
iron & then with a big file, they adapt it on the
wheel & first of all they wrap their
desgrusouedesgrusouer
with a rope, as thick rope as
the little finger, & lean it firmly on the
crossbar to secure it well. And while someone else promptly
turns the wheel, they guide the sharp edge of the
esgrusouer by hands towards the edge of the round cavity, & gently
guide it to the center of the circle. And this
desgrusouer is for removing the first rough &
lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a cutting
iron called a plane, on which they rub the
sharp edge with a little putty, on leathernailed
onto a piece of woodhaving, and this, in such a way
that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this
plane was not thus rubbed & burnished, it would
not polish & notburnish the tin,
au which would stay white, & not black &
polished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second
time with this plane as they did with the
esgrusouer. Then, with a knife or another
sharp iron, they scrape the edges of the plates or
dishes to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled

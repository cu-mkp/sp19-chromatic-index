From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
crusting & removing anything from the mold, because the
wax, being taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make
your vents coming from the head, which is in the bottom, towards the
gate. Make also your gate so that it is toobut
little thick, and make within its course two or three notches, for
this breaks up the fury of the metal and makes it flow with ease,
without bubbling nor making too much smoke, which hinders its run. You
can divide it also in two or three branches thus



when it approaches the molded thing, and always make holes in the
gate.

& from these conduits & abrevouers, you can also
put there small threads of wax, which are joined to the body, in
order that the metal goes more easily from one part to another
& runs quickly everywhere. And from these conduits, you lead your
gates & your vents without spoiling anything.


Plaster

When you v mold something to cast wax in it, you
mold in plaster alone, reheated after having been pulverized.
For, once reheated in stone, the outside is cooked & the
inside stays almost raw. Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but
a good one, is one, that, once wet, is white & sets very
quickly. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm, & hard
after having set, but its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the
nature of each. If you You will never mold very neatly if
ne you do not wet, very thin &
liquid, your plaster or your sand for noyau. Wet it
mortar quickly after it has been reheated.

+
If you mold with plastercrud alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first
mold. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,
soak it for a long time in water. And if it does not want to
release, soak it in hot water, for cold water hardens it,
and hot water softens it further. Cold water does not
penetrate it like it does with mixed plaster, because it is harder &
the mixed one is more spongy. With this plaster, thus reheated as
powder, one can cast medals that do not fear the rain,
especially if they are varnished. One can find these in
Germany, on the houses. But take heed that the water be
very hot, & if it is boiling, there is no danger. All
plaster molds, pure or mixed, release in it.


Scimitars
To know
The workers from Damascus or from
Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate, in the
mine, iron from steel. And, from this
first steel, first melted from its mine, they
cast scimitar blades in sand sab blades of the
scimitar, that after, cut the other iron without any difficulty,
because any melted iron is harder than doulx iron
beaten from pigs & bars. Thus is the steel of scimitars, but
it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts b a scimitar,
one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
sand.


Hearing from afar

Make a small hole in the earth, & place your ear fully
there, at night or at a silent time, & you will easily
hear the noise.

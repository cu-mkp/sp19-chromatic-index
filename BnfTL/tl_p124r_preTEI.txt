Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers

Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hairs raise up
& come out looking mixed up & to clumped
together. Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative
& that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is
wheat oil, with which you will smear it. Once cast, you
will be able to repair it. The bodies of butterflies and
plants, that have the stem & the leaves that are wooly with some
hair, capricious & downy, need also to be smeared with the same
oil, to keep these hairs laid down; likewise flowers that have
leaves very delicate & thin, for dry wheat oil makes
them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
dandelion or a pappus, which comes from the
seeds of burdock & flies away at the slightest sigh of
wind.


Noyaulx for molding hollow

Animals of gold & silver can readily be molded
s hollow, to avoid weightiness, and costs as well,
if they are not very small. But to make the core & the
noyau, one needs the mold to be freshly molded &
not dry.


Spiderâ€™s web

It comes undone in water & thusly, cannot be molded in a
noyau, but one casts the spider and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make in the fields
on some carton with a point. One makes
around an edge of paper, glued to the
carton & one casts with tin, very little
alloyed with lead.


Fine gold

There is a species of gold which, even though it is very fine
& unalloyed & has been passed through aquafortis &
antimony, is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the
hammer. And the composition of verdet described above to
make gold run, makes it as doux as
lead.

For casting in silver

You need to arrange your animals as said, and compose the same sand
two parts of out of 4 parts of
plaster, of two partsreheated brick, & one
partalum de plume reheated, and mix
it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
take the three parts of an earthenware bowl, from which
the peasants eat their soup, of the aforementioned
sand, & add to it pure alum de plume,
reheated & pulverized in the mortar, as much as you
can grab with 4 fingers and the thumb, or a
small double handful. Then, mix mix well & wet
with a little sal ammoniac & the rest of the common
water+ & stir it with your pallet, so
that it all becomes like a thick sauce or light
mustard. & having rubbed, with the
pinceau, the animal with eau-de-vie, cast &
blow, and beat the table to shake the mold & do as
with others.

Do not forget to put in it crocum, for it prevents
the molds from cracking, & is appropriate for all
metals.

Alloyed silver is better for casting than the fine one, provided
that it is doulx.


One needs for the alum de plume to be well pulverized
and well mixed.

Sal ammoniac is a friend of gold & of
silver.

Which needs to be placed before the sand in the bowl,
which is put in the water, & not the water in the
sand

Latten is the enemy ofgold & the friend of
silver.


Silver for casting

It is not fine silver but alloyed, & which does not
become perfectly white on the fire, they put it to whiten after the
fusion to also clean it of the solder. or of the When
you need to attach some leg animal against another or to
repair, it is commonly teston silver. And, all
alloyed silver, as long as it is douls, is good.

Before starting to cast in silver, one needs to
have earthof which which withstands the fire, like
the sandy earthde qu mixed with cloth
waste which founders use to cast their canons, or any
good lute which withstand fire, in order to surround your
molds & fortify them, for one needs for them to be red. One
needs to also tie them with iron wire.

That before casting sil reheating the molds, you
have the mixture one needs to make the silver run.

If the goldsmiths knew knew the substance to make
silver run in their works, they would buy a lot. Some buy it five
sols for a denier.


I have used silver from the capital.


Before binding luting & strengthening your molds
for gold & silver with the said earth, one
needs for the cast to be made & the vents, & the molds
to have been reheated of very red, to burn the animals,
flowers and plants that are inside, & to clean them well of the
ashes. Once well clean & prepared, lute them & bind them
with iron wire, & reheat them again until they will
be well red.

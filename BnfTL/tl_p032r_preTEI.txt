The body of the cuirass

The high lames of the pauldron of the brassard @ are like a
masterpiece of the masters, for these pieces it is necessary
that they be very precisely hollowed &
adjusted in order that the movement may be free. The bodies of the
cuirass must be very evenly beaten &
driven with a hammer.

Morions from Milan are all in one piece & thus better
than those that are of two.


Painter

As soon as the colors of panels are well dried, the Flemish
varnish them so they do not die any further & remain in that
state.

The one who knows to work well in distemper will work well in
oil. But, on the contrary, the one who knows how to work well in
oil will not work in distemper.


For layering gold in distemper

Common painters & scribes make
batture, which is joiner's glue tempered with
water on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very little
honey, that is to say a few drops to make it stick, and
with it they they form letters, or that which they want to gild,
with a pinceau, and immediately after layer the
gold, but they never do their work quite neatly, and if there is
a lot of honey it dries only with great difficulty. This layer is
undone in the rain.

Others do better, they temper candy sugar in water and
mix it with sanguine that they call
cocon, thoroughly ground, adding a little
soap. This is done neatly, & renders gold beautiful if
one uses it as the ground layer.

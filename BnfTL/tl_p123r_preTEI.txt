Take white arsenic, two ounces, 2
℥Orpiment or yellow arsenic, two ounces, 2
℥Aes ustum, two ounces, 2
℥Fine copper filings moderately ground, 2
℥Antimony, 2 ℥Rock salt, 2 ℥Raw Tartar, 2 ℥Sandever, 2 ℥Saltpeter, half that is to say 1
℥Coarse common salt melted, half, 1
℥Sublimate, half, 1 ℥Borax, half, 1 ℥Sal ammoniac, as much as borax, that is to say 1
℥

Take these substances, of the best kind you can find. Weigh them as
said above, and pestle them separately, keeping your
face covered, over the nose & the
mouth, from the eyes down, to avoid the exhalations of
arsenic, sublimate, and orpiment. Mix them well all
together, then put them in a good crucible that is so large
that the substances can have space of the fourth or fifth part.
Cover the crucible with a good tile, adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with iron wire quite strongly, lute it
with earth mixed with dung or founder’s earth, that artillery
founders use. And in this, be careful & diligent, & do
not forget to mix in crushed glass throughout the lute to
fortify your crucible, in such a manner that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the 4five last ingredients would be exhaled. 


Note that you need to lute well your crucible, in order that the
substances do not take air, for they would be exhaled.



Lute well your crucible, in order that it does not break. For
if it breaks, the substances evaporate & the fumes in it are
dangerous. If within 12 hours it is not melted
and mixed, it will not be well made. 

Goldsmiths who know about this substance sell a
denier of it for 5 sols to other
goldsmiths, & especially to those who make dishware
in quantity, for at the end of their works, they can solder
over the first solder by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold & cast something delicate. This mixture
should not be divulged, in order that it is not abused.

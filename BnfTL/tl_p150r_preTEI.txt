Very strong wax

Mix with this resin and bole, and do not cast it very
hot.


Various alloys of tin and lead

For hollow things like turtles, halffine
lead and halftin.

For flowers, almost all tin, namely a lb of fine
tin and two ℥ of fine lead.

For lizards that are as thick as one or two
fingers, almost all lead, namely a lb
of fine lead and 4 ℥es of fine tin.


Molds

They are less subject to cleaving while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of a little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For when thin, they scarcely need to be
recui on the fire, & a long time on the fire
makes them corrupt, especially when the plaster is not
strong.

It is better to reheat a mold on its own than several
together, because one needs a larger & more violent fire for several
than for one. And, glowing charcoal stopping up the space between
the molds, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such
a way that more often you will find your molds burst &
cleaved open on one side more than another.

Therefore reheat your molds alone, not making fire there,
except to cover it.

And because your lead and tin become sour when
frequently melted red, to soften it melt it without reddening it and
cast in a rod.

Brick cools the metal, & if this was for giving a
bond, it will not be necessary.



The reheated molds cannot withstand several casts. But those in
which one wants to cast only lead or tinandor flat medals, having been only
dried, withstand many.

Very finely ground iron scales render them very firm &
strong.

Molding very thin like bimbalotiers do

They mold in paper &
carton, for neither earth, sand, nor
metal would mold as neatly, & would not receive. Or else they
engrave in stone from Istre the
principal side, & the reverse is of paper or
carton.


Reducing a round figure into a hollow one

You need to firstly mold it with some plaster, as said
before, & in the plaster cast in wax, from which will
come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
bmodel it as you fancy. And then, you will model
this relief of wax again in plaster, or better yet, with
your wet sand # like for noyau, & in the
latter cast in some lead, & from this you will have a very
neat relief, & if it is not, repair on the ciment or
otherwise, & take heed that it is always of good release. And
this one will always serve you well for making as many hollows as you
please, in this way. Place half of your figure of
lead, oiled & wetted with eau-de-vie according
to the above, in the clay slab, then mold this half with
some white plaster. Having set nextand having
well smoothed & flattened the plaster, take your
black wax mixed with sulfur, as is said, because it leaves
nothing in the mold & melts quicker. Wet it in warm
urine, & once softened enough, make it into an imprint
on the half of the lead figure, and it you will have a
very neat hollow. Shape next the wax hollow in a square shape, as
you please, with sufficient thickness & smooth it well on all sides,
& thus next, mold this hollowed wax, both
imprinted on one part & flat & smooth on the other, in the same
fashion that you mold flat medals of wax or othermetal in noyau. And the mold in noyau
will render in silver or such metal as pleases you
the m a similar figure to the wax, that is to
say flat & smooth on one side & hollow on the other. And having
cleaned & put this hollow to be whitened, if it is silver,
you will be able to mix there some works of sugar,

#

having made a hole in your clay slab & having
en packed in it half of the figure of wax, a little oiled, to pull it out
better.

Transparent wax is not good, but rather the one which has body,
to make an imprint well.



As you have molded with plaster & wax one half, you
can mold the other the same.

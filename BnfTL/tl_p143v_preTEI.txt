one leg up to the other, in order that the spread out extremities
come to join one with the other through the means of the said gates,
which you will start in the round parts, empty of wax, that you
have put at the end of the feet to attract the metal. Thusly, the
gate being made by wax, you are in no danger of encrusting
something from the molded animal. And it is more expedient to make
thusly the gate of wax, to cast the second mold on top, than to
wait to do them after the mold is
reheatedq, for at that point, it is necessary, if
possible, that everything be ready. One needs to heat well & even
redden the molds, where they are gates of wax, in order
that it melts well & leaves nothing inside.


Carcanets made Ã  jour

They are molded like crayfish in noyau, first with
one side being raised up with clay which is hollow, & then
one uncovers them from the other side & one makes the second
casting. They are also able to be cast well in frames, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
wax, or else one fills the cavities that were not able to release
with wax or clay.


Iron filings

Because usually filings are mixed with nastiness, it
is good to redden them in fire to burn the impurities, and then
wash them in clear water. In this way, the dirt will go to the
top of the water, that you throw out, & the good
filings will go to the bottom.


Carnations

Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, or
bi they are weighty & for this reason, one makes them
with leaves & blades of silver.

Mat maker

They make two kinds of them in Toulouse, one to hang on the
partition walls of rooms, which they weave almost as fine as
the strawhats worn by villagers. And
they make them in long bands, some the width of ten
bstraws, others of thirteen. And they
work on them mainly in summer. And in
winter, when they put it to use, they sew it. But beforehand,
they put it in dye and commonly make it in three colors, green,
red, and sometimes violet. The green one is made in pastel
woad dye only, because green being made from yellow and blue, the
pastel woad discharging itself onto the straw,
which shows its dark yellow, one obtains bright green. For the red, they
use alum and brazilwood. For the violet, they use
pastel woad & a little copperas, which
darkens the blue with its black dye.


Glassmaker

They have no invention for making a perfect red in a work, so that
one needs to reheat it. However try the German
red, which is rouge d'escaille. They make their common
red with some sanguine, looking-glass tin, rock
pieces, litharge & a bit of scales of iron. The
said red saturates one side & the other of the glass in order
that it has more color, if it saturated only one side it would be very
pale orange.


Founder

They pay xx lb for a quintal of rosette,
which is harder to melt than latten because it is softer. For,
the softer the great metals# are, the soft harder they are
to melt. The tin used to make bells, which is fine tinis more and which is brittle, is easier to melt than lead,
which is soft. Latten, made brittle by the calamine is
melted more quickly than red copper. The metal, which is the
substance of bells, mixed with tin, and very brittle, is soon
melted. The more silver is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
why solder is made with it. In Germany they make very
light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
water, but they are breakable. A quintal of
perfine coppersmith's rosette is
sold for xxx or 40 lb. Another type used by founders
is sold for xii or xv lb. The quintal of metal,
six lb.Put in

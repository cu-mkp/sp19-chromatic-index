For shooting a gun without noise

Warm the pipe well & plug the touch
hole below, & take a piece of porkfat, the freshest
that you can, as long as the joint of your little
finger & of the caliber, & put it in the pipe &
move it up and down until it is completely melted. Next, load the pipe
at the top with a socket that is
held on the ramrod, as you know, & it will only make a
little whistle.


For tempering a ball that will pierce and will make healing
difficult

Mix fat & strong vinegar & throw your ball
very hot into this mixture.


Against wounds

Cut a chicken or a dog to test & put
sap & pestled herb which is called
semperviva in the wound. It is the kind
which has leaves like small grains which some call
vermicularis. And one takes for granted that it
will not die.

of the biggest snails you can, with their shell, put them in a
glass bottle with a sufficient quantity of very hard
& thoroughly boiled egg yolks with good vinegar.
Stopper the whole well & put it under horsedung for
the space of fifteen days. The snails will
first live on the egg yolks, then with the heat they will come
out of their shells & eat & live on those. Finally, a white
ointment is made with it. Without cutting open the bottleyou put, which above all for your safety you

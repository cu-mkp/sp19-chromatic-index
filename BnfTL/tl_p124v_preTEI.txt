Rouge clair @
enamel

Fine gold is opposed to it, for  on it it
remains yellowish. But alloyed gold is more appropriate for it,
such as that of escu & pistolet. IfGoldfis not put back on the fire with its
own pale color renders the enamel a dead colour.
Ma And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back
on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the enamels
beautiful. Otherwise, they are matte.

There is rouge clair which, once it is used with
arene, loses its beauty.

Some can be found that have grains of gold inside, and it is
also the opinion of good goldsmiths that the good one is made
with gold.


Casting with gold

Molds are reheated better & more surely in a closed
fire, such as pot in a reverberatory
furnace. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some
important piece dâ€™or e that cost a lot to rough out in
wax, they put the molds in a pot & cover
them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire
that holds them together & tight. Then, they reheat the
mold, earth & pot together, and when
everything is well red, they cast the gold.Fine gold does
not run well, but alloyed gold does well.

Gold & silver do not sour, having been, once
entirely red and hot, dipped in water.

Gold is a quarter heavier thanlead.



When gold reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
emerald.



Take care that where you want to cast the gold, there has been no
fall of lead, tin, or lime thereof in the
forge.


A means to make the gate for small female lizards

Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is
so delicate and thin that the casting will find it hardmetal would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled,
roll wax in little threads of this size



and apply some with the hot iron wire, as said, one at
the end of the tail & the others, that are applied in the same way,
from one edgeside of the tail to the other, as
you see depicted. But take heed to make sure, that with the end of
the hot iron wire, the end of the wax barely touches
the animal, for the sand of the second cast will not touch this part.
But make sure that the end of the wax arranges itself only at the
edge of the empty part of the first mold. Make also conduits of
wax around the legs &, around the contours of the body, which
are a little long & they will serve as abreuvoirs for the
molded thing.

Follow here above

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out
well, the rest will also come out well.



The principal thing is that the ears of the snake come out
well-molded.



Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal & of the
thickness of a knife.

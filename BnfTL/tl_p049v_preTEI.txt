Birds

Calandra larks & all
birds taken from the nest & which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the savage ones give  much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken before Michaelmas,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call gaillardise,
which makes them sick & sometimes makes them die, especially
calandra larks. One knows when they are sad & do not sing.
One must pierce it av, not with a pin, but
very gently by turning with the tip of quite pointy feather.
The calandra lark does not want to be without grey
river sand, & the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself
& cleanses itself with it.




Grain of lead

Take a piercedplaying card, pierced with a
pin or needle, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small split stick and, holding the said
stick by theun boutother end,
put your card three or 4 fingers away from
the water that you will have put in a dish or similar
vessel. Then pour your lead, which should not be too
hot, into the card & continually tap on the stick
that holds it. And thus your lead will turn into round grains.
And pass it through a large sieve to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The larger one will reach 25 to 30 paces.




Birds

Those that can are taken at Michaelmas are
good for keeping, but those that are taken in March die,
because they are starting to enter into love. Bénaris
are fed oats all summer in order that they are fed without
fattening, to be more appropriate for hunting & taking the others.
Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
millet. They sing at night. One needs to
c take them after mid-July until
Michaelmas, for after that time that they have their young in
this country, they go like the turtledoves. Siskins
should also be taken from All Saints' Day until
Christmas, for after they go to the mountains to
brood.



Bénaris are ventriloquists, such that singing without
opening the beak, one would say that they are

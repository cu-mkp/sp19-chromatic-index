This thus prepared, place your de first
half-mold on the tourtelle of earthclay, & put the circle also around, & make the mark for
the thickness similar to the first. Then, with another rather thickish
pinceau, moisten well everywhere the uncovered half
& le ventre of your animal
Etwith eau-de-vie,
without leaving anything, if it is possible, which is not moistened, for
this is the secret, which makes it come out neat. And next, as promptly
as possible, before the eau-de-viene evaporates, wet your sand, and throw it, in
shakes, and while blowing, & moving the mold, as you did
for the first one, making sure that the premier q
first thing you pour on the animal should be a little clearer than the
next one, so that it moistens everywhere &retrace the more delicate
parts. So, leave it for a quarter hour to set, then
remove the circle & the claytourtelle. And, with a
knife, arrange your two molds uniformly together in a
long shape of a mandore, as mentioned, because of the cast.
Then dip a little the whole mold evenly, at the level of the
joints, in water, for this is another secret to unjoin them,
otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore by
this mean, and next, extract gently & with patience and immediacy
the half of the animal remaining in one of the molds,
for pulling it sometimes from one side & sometimes from
the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from
your mold. Et The latter being empty,
retire rejoints the two halves so that no dust
enters it, & put them aside until you want to reheat them, make a
cast & vents, & place clamps. As for the animal, so
that it does not dry & that you might be able to mold it four of
five times, put in in water. And I think that it would keep even
better in eau-de-vie. However, the best would be to mold
in the same day the 4 or 5 molds that you can do,
because these infected animals themselves are stinky in one
day. Having left your molds one or two
esdays to dry, for they stay
damp for a good month, make the vents on one
half.

+ Note that when you have made your second
cast, if you leave your mold, for one
day or a night, without opening
it, you would need to then dip it in hot water, or else reheat it
before opening it, as for crabs.



If after both halves of the noyau have made a strong & hard set, you
would not dip your mold in water, it would not unjoin at
all. But as you dip the reverse of the mold in water,
the imbibed oil collects at the top & at the level of the
joints & and makes it separate.



However, take heed your second mold be of good thickness &
that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having
dipped it in water, & you want to open it, there is a risk
that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
it, dip all of it in water, and rub it everywhere,
where it will harden if it has set well.Then, take your two
molds, joined with a rough linen cloth, in in
order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
wanted to quarter a loaf of bread. But if happens to break, join
it & on the reverse, strenghten the joints with clamps.





Next, you can repair the faults with small chisels.

To make â˜€ run

Verdigris & sal ammoniac, as much of one as the
other, borax & saltpeter, as much of one as
the other. But the sborax &
sel armosaltpeter together must only weigh
half of the others, that is to say, as much together as the
verdigris. Grind them finely into powder on
marble, then grind them again with some good strong
vinegar until it is fine, like a couleur and
verdet ground in oil. Next, leave it to dry on its own if
you have time, or in the fire lent of the
forge, & make sure it is well dry.

One of the principal things for the cast is to cast very
gec hot, s especially great
metals.




For gold casts for large works



One needs not only to clamp the molds well, but to
fortify them with good iron wire or little
bands made for this.



Before casting in gold, clean your forge well of
lead & tin.


Secret for solderinggold and silver for
small works



If some piece of small foot does not come out well in gold or
silver, by fault of not having made, underneath, a gate of
wax, beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in
as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm
 or white thick which saliva that is found on
the teeth, & with the point of a burin,
apply it to the place you want to solder & place there a
little spangle of gold & next, with a little fat
earth, wet with saliva, make a small layer, on the
opposite side, to hold solder better. Next, pulverize on top a
little borax & put in the fire. Boiled water of
quince seed & others also.

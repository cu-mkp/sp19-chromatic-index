burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts remain inside. Next one
needs to clean them & remove the ashes. Secondly, reheat them
& render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some
charcoals, gently lit, and put your noyau molds flat
on the charcoals surrounded by bricks. Frame molds are
reheated on a grill.




Molding bouquets, plants and flowers

 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
 wilt & dry out. Dip them, therefore,
immediately in good eau-de-vie & then put them in your
wet sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no
release, for while the molds being sreheated, the plant burns, which does not happen with
animals, which have bones & q. It is necessary
that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes
because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.




Molding deen noyau with the same
sand, wax images or lead medals and suchlike

Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax
what does not, and then smear your images of wax or of
lead with olive oil, very thinly & very
lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the
medal. Then, heat a little eau-de-vieuntil & when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled
medal with it, for if it is the water were cold, it
would reject the oil, it would not set well. Next, cast your sand
of plaster, brimatton, &
wet alum on top. Having arranged your image on the claymandore & having made a circle around it
de to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
are oiled and rubbed thusly with eau-de-vie
because they are firm & hard & would not be malleable for taking
out of thelamold, which is
tenacious, as are the animals from nature, which are soft &
flexible.



When you have wet your sand, do not throw it in the middle of the
mold, but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently, and
that the beginning is not thick & afterwards thick. If your wet sand
sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that
is not thick enough. Make it therefore of average thickness.




Casting for gold and silver



It is necessary that the molds be fiery red & ablaze when
you cast in gold & silver, or you burn flowers and
bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the
molded thing, because the substance flows better when at ease and
without shaking the mold & does not become as porous.


A way to unmoldenamelgold
very delicate goldrose leaves and others



After you have cast or beaten in gold the thin leaves of a
rose or other things, if you want to enamel them, you
need to solder or braze your delicate gold leaves onto
silver strips, which uy will strengthen them
to support the enamel. Next, once the thing has been
enameled, put the work in aqua
dfortis, which will eat away the
silver & leave all the gold with its enamel.
For this, the gold needs to be passed

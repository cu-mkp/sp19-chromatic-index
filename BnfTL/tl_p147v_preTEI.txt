I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small
representations & thin as paper. I have cast very hot in the
very red mold, and have put in the melted substance of
thisthe two substances compositions,
which make silver runny, & have made as if I had wanted to
cast pure silver. This alloy is white in
bullitoire, like any alloys which resemble, however
little, ☾. For casting something delicate, use
this one.


Lute

There is no better than the one that has which you have
molded, namely pieces from your molds. But one needs to choose
those better reheated.


Crucible

Take heed that it is three fingers from
fe the mouth of the bellows, & that the
said bellows beats from us underneath the
bottom of the crucible, otherwise it would cool it.


Cast of latten

I took the one of latten skillets, which are beaten &
forged thinly. I Once well heated, I cast in it
two or three grains, like peas, of sal
ammoniac. This clarified it, like a mirror. Once very white from the
force of being hot, I cast in it some pulverized calamine, raw &
pure. I cast it in its very red mold. It came out very neat
& thin like paper, & hollow on the reverse. But because
it had developed a chappe, I reheated it, that is to say
reddened, let it cool, then put it to be whitened, of one partraw tartar & of one halfcommon salt. Once
well boiled, I rubbed it with a scratch-brush, in clear
water. And because the first time it had not



Do not let it cool when melting. It always makes a tail, like melted
glass, because of the calamine.



Usually, the soft latten of skillets, becomes red from casting,
especially when it stays a long time in the fire, m
because the calamine exhales itself. But sour latten of
candlesticks becomes yellow & pin filings.

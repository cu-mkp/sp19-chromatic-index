with halflead comes out almost better than tin
pureor or pure lead, even
though in any case they come out well. Nevertheless take care not to
cast lead not as hot as tin. In big works it is necessary
to moisten the sands with magistra or glair of egg.

Three things take the longest to make, leaves, hair &
garlands.


Sand

You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way lean
& arid, such that it does not bind at all, like the one from the
sea or deseifrom sandy
paths dried out by the sun. But choose
them or in t preferably from
quarreriesries or rock caves,
because that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the
vein if, in the greyish rocks or quarriesqu that seem to be made of arene,
you see after rainy weather, certain little
amounts like dust attached to the said rocks, or if a little
piece flakes off, easily crushed between your hands,
due to humidity. You will also find it in lean soils, which comes
off in lop large lumps like stones of
tufet ne, or among terres
boulv√®nes, which are much better than those from
fat & strong earths. And one ought not to take it from the
surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth, but three
or 4 feet below & the closest to the
tuf or stone. Since it comes out in large lumps
one would say it starts to form itself in stone. But when it is wet, it
comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it
is well granular, & that when crushing it between the
fingers, it renders itself really very fine, like
impalpable, keeping nevertheless its asperity of
arene, without muddying the
fingers like clay. It dries up slightly on the
fire, then it is pestled & passed finely through a double
sieve or a linen sleeve, then takes moistures with
wine or magistra & @ / Verte


The Toulousemolder reheats it strongly then grinds
it finely on marble and passes it through a
linen & moistens pass it with
wine. He makes the cast very broad & ne
flat & barely deep. He casts pure latton used for scales
& similar thin things. He casts very hot.


@ Try calcined vitriol.

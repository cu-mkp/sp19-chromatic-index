Plowman

Because millet is naturally very dry,
harvesters beat it most often at night in the cool
& by moonlight. Which could not be done with another
grain that is wetter, for one le must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the sun is
approaching midday. Quickly after the millet is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats & thins it as
much as if the millet was still standing. The ground
where the millet will have been sown is quite
diminished of its fertility & c, which one knows
wellat the next sowing that one makes. But above
all the grain called
pomole in Gascony or
baillard in northern
France, makes, according to the common
saying, the earth shake seven years later. Beans
improve & enrich the soil, as long as one lets the roots & stems
rot in it.


Painter

Some, having laid down their color, soften it with the back of a
feather but the large brush is best.


Merchant

They commonly have four books. The tyrant, which is a
formulary for apprentices, by which they can know how much
every item of merchandise costs & cofor how much
it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in
rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they
reduce to clean copy and put the retail account of what is contained in
the waste book. The fourth is the account book, which mentions the sale,
the balanced account, the bill & the term of payment, & this
book l is taken as evidence in
court.

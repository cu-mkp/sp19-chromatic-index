Lake takes long to dry in oil and for that reason one must
grind glass in it. But one needs to choose crystallin
because it is neater. And because it would be too difficult to grind by
itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it
into cold water, & it will be crumbled & pulverized
easily for grinding after. Being well ground it with a lot of
water, it resembles ground lead white, but for this it has
no body. I think it would be good for casting.

Lead white is made with sheet lead beaten subtle & put
under the dung.

White varnish of turpentine or of spike lavender
oil and turpentine is colored with pulverized
terra emerita, making it boil together. It gives agold
color on silver and more beautiful if it is burnished. It is dry
in a quarter of an hour. Aloe would make brighter
color, but it takes long to dry & the other is dry in a quarter
of an hour, in winter as well as
summer.



Good lake moistened with saliva is rendered promptly dark.
That from Florence is too gummed.



If you make a layer of printers' ink on velvet
and there apply gold leaf and then stretch the velvet, it
will appear grainy as if there were gold powder disseminated on
it.

Vermillion ground by itself is wan and pale, but ground after
lake, it is more beautiful.

For taking the fattiness from marbles, one grinds
ordinary ashes on it, which is good afterward to make the first
primer coat of a panel that is prepared in oil in order to seal
the cracks & chinks of the wood. It has more body than
chalk & it has chalk a certain fattiness.
One mixes it with the aforesaid chalk or ra
with the colors collected from the vessel where one cleans the
pinceaulx. It is desiccative and spares colors.
On Once this primer coat is made on the wood, one
scrapes with a knife to even it. Next one makes a second coat
of ceruse or of the poorest colors mixed together. In
a painting in oilon canvas, one applies only
one coat, and the same ashes can be used there. Also, after one
has ground a color, one grinds some pith of coarse bread on it to
remove the fattiness from the marble.

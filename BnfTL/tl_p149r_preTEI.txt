Softening iron and rendering it very soft

Take sublimate, quicklime, soap from
Venice, horse dung, a little less
sublimate than the others. Wet all of this together like paste
& with this impaste the iron, & to do this envelope it
with some bad linen. Then make it reheat until it is
very red. Or leave overnight in a good fire until the
morning. It will be very soft for engraving on it well
whatever you want.


Base gold from Germany,
electre

One calls it gold from the Rhine , which one finds
in the rivers, and is spangle gold.
Goldsmiths from Germany wanted to refine it,
thinking to separate it from this whiteness which they deemed to be
silver. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that
this whiteness is fixed & it does not lack color. This is
electre, from which one is able to make cups,
which will demonstrate poison.


Various arts from Germany

They are very much helped by water mills, &
most of the artisans of metals, of gold, & of
silver, & others, at the trip hammers,
make get their large works beaten. And to draw iron
wire, they redden large masses of iron, & having made it
into a point, they make it hang while totally red, & thus promptly
draw the wire.


Repairing a medal

If you want to mold any medal to serve as your pattern, & at the
same time repair it, cast it in a majority of tin & put in a
copious amount of looking-glass tin to harden it.

cool by itself. When it begins to redden, it is soon red everywhere.
But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom & that
nothing appears black.


Common sand from the mine

In a frame, if one casts hot, it becomes porous, therefore
one only needs to dry it out.


I have tried to make the molds, where it is mixed, not crack
during reheating, & thus not make flaws.


It is better made with distilled vinegar.


Crocum ferri

Having d passed it through vinegar &
reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on porphyry,
until no roughness was recognisable on the nail. Then,
I wet it with very good vinegar, & a’ left it two or three days, stirring
it several times each day. Finally I boiled it,
& reddened in the pot &
crocum all together in the four à
vent. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that
can be pulverized very finely between the fingers. I
put some in the sand, ahalf as much as
alum de plume. I wet the sand quite thinly & molded
out of it a very small lizard, which molded very neatly &
delicately & very finely. The crocum ferri did not
render the mold harder, but it firmed it. And when your
mold is douls & fat, when scraping it with a
nail, it is a sign that the crocum is
good, very fine & well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that
silver would come out well. And that the mold, through
this means, does not crack. Make it from filings of
needles.


One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast
silver, for it firms the molds, and you will find it so,
by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none. It molds
very neatly.


This one is appropriate for all molds, & keeps them from
breaking & bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands
several casts. The one of steel fillings & needles is redder
& better.


Gilding animals cast in silver

You can gild them with amalgam, without spoiling any
of the features, if they are made of silver.

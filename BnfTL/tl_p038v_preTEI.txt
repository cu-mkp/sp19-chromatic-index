Black color for dyeing

Take lye of quicklime & litharge, mix & soak,
& you will make a dark brown dye, & reiterating the same
you will make black. Try other colors with lye of lime.


Against nose bleeding and for dyeing

Pestle some sorrel or lapathum
acutum of the sort that is red-veined, which is called
dragonâ€™s blood, and apply it de to
the bleeding person's forehead. This herb is a strong
dye & makes beautiful violet.


Beautiful artichokes

One needs to cleanse themevery year so that only
one foot is left, & water them thoroughly. L
Also replant some every year, for the second
year they will bear very beautiful fruit.


Planting trees

One says that rarely a tree planted on Saint Paul's
day needs to take, & for covering the bark, cow dung
is very appropriate, for it is not undone in the rain like earth.


Merchant

Those who sell velvet & es other
stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by
retail & in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have
only their sales book & their account book. But those who sell in
bulk & those who traffic in pastel woad have
double-entry books.


Scarlets

Because one aulne costs seven or eight
lb. to dye, they use cloths worth seven or eight
francs an aulne. But whoever wants something
beautiful se la should buy white cloth worth
fifteen francs an aulne & have it dyed with
pure scarlet pastel & a little cochineal.
Black cloth comes thin because the dyeing is
inexpensive.

A way for molding excellently with water



Dissolve in damp place some tallow of glass, and then
place this water on what you want to mold, having encircled it,
and place it to coagulate on the hot ashes. Do the same with
vitriol & copperas, which, once well calcined, reduce
in water.




Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.



It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper, latten or
similar metal, very neatly, and then when you have molded the
cavity in the sand, leave the figure of metal that
you have molded in the frame, without moving it
from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a
little & push the figure down in the frame.



It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the
filth & grime accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face towards the cast, some grime could be found
there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.

Vinegar is better for moistening than wine. It is
necessary that the frame be well smooth and even, otherwise
and that the cast be, as you press on one side, the other one
lifts.



This is why the press is better, for it tightens evenly, &
more than your hands, and makes

the lumpy sand, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the
soft & fine sand, which is sprinkled & ponc√© dry
on the medal.



When you mold, always leave your medal in one oftheframes, iswithout stirring
it because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put
it back in the right place by means of pegs, which will prevent
it from shifting. But, at first, ponce yout medal with very
fine willow charcoal, & se next
clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release.

Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the
frame & the sand.


Bellows

To melt with bellows, & hasten your fonte,
& also cast hotter po, do not place your
bellows at the bottom near the foot of the furnace,
for fear that some charcoal might you enters it, put
them almost under the grille. It is good that your
bellow furnace be in an aerated place so that the
wind might make it heat better, & that it be well dry
& and reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace
& that there is only entry of the tuelle of the
bellows. And by the end, one ought to give it a good stoking,
since at the beginning you will blow gently.

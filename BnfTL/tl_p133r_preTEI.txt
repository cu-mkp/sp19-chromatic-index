Hard wax for imprinting seals

It is made from white wax, which is harder than the other,
& one mixes in very finely ground ceruse or lead white until
it becomes as hard as you fancy u, adding to it a
drop of turpentine to bind it. Next mix in whatever
color you want. That is the waxgoldsmiths use for
modeling.


Feet of smalls lizards for
gold and silver

Because the feet of these, which are very small, are very delicate,
as you molded the top and d uncovered the belly
& the bottom of the feet, cover them lightly with wax &
then cast the second mold. And the wax being removed, it
leaves a g little gate for the aforesaid feet. And
should the bottom of these come of in one piece, you can repair it. And
the scales from the top of the toes will come out well.



At the end of the nails oflarge lizards, place
make on each one a little circle of wax, to make the
gate thusly :


Marks from the points of iron wire which are found
on the head of the animal

L With the points, one has previously
set the stance, especially that of the head. But the head being pierced,
there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,
which hinders the sand from covering the point & there
always remains some little opening g. But to avoid
this, you can plant in the slab of the an
iron point, arro cleaned &
rounded at the top end & on this end place there a little hard
wax or du a little mastic or
cement, and through the means of this hot iron
wire, hold in place the throat of the animal, which can be removed
when you come to uncover the belly & the throat to make the second
cast.


Clamps and broken mold

When you have made the first reheating & removed the
clamps, and you have the opened your mold
to clean it by blowing, with quicksilver, which is used only in
enclosed molds, close the mold again & put the
clamps on again, but not in the first place where they were.
Lute again & dry again. But if it is for a cast with
silver or gold, lute with the remainder of the sand
that was used, for it is the safest. If your mold, while
reheating, is broken, you can adjust it with some clamps &
lute.

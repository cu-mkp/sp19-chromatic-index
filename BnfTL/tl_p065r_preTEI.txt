Shadows

 Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black, others
tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which tend
towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in oil, for shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground jet, which you will mix with a little
yellow ochre & lead white. Or else, after
you have ground your lead whitebro and
clean p gathered it with the , grind the jet into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some
black of , a little sap-green & bistre, &
you will have a perfect shadow for women in distemper.



The powder of orber√©grain is darker than
umber & when you lack umber, the said powder will do,
but it does not have body.


Flesh color

You must know well the mixing of colors & the appropriate
shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note &
observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise,
as if going from l{ett}re a ga right to
left like



, and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.


Mirror

When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
cristallinmirror, which represents
well after nature, and in which it you will see if your
shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
candle, for firelight will make the shadows reddish.
The painter also teacher himself with the mirror,
for he sees in it what the natural can do.


Greasy colors

If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, & that
the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry layer, unless
you rub this part with soap or breathe on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.



One cannot layer oil on cut paper & model as in
distemper because the colour would run. Thus, to gild with
or mat, one needs to pounce & then layer the gold
color with the pinceau.



All greasy colors, such as ceruse and minium,
massicot, ochre, lead white are good for making
gold color.



Any color or thing that thickens when water is put with it when
it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as
cristallin, lake & become clear.

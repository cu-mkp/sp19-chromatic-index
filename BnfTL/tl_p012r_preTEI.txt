For molding sulfur

Sulfur is made beautiful mixed with soot black or with
pulverized sanguine, which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like oil, mix it with
verdigris, and you m will cast in
plaster very neat a lizard, or something else.



You must not cast that which has not become well cooled & that which
has not lost all its pustules & bubbles, and has not settled down
well & become smooth like water. The
soot black gives it a fine luster & makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow sulfur must be used, for the greyish &
lively sulfur is not good. Do not cast in wind &
cold, for it would become porous.


Chimolee

The terre chimolee, otherwise known as
fullerâ€™s earth, with which they dress the
cloth, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warmed, & reheat it gently on a
low, indirect fire, & little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a pot in an oven, or in a
covered oven. It is very malleable, clean & fine. You
can make a cavity for animals of chimolee & cast
lead in it.



The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days before you reheat
it. When you mold & make a cavity from chimolee, do
not press too hard, but softly, for it would break.


Paper

The whitest & finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite
clean, as of sulfur or baked chimolee, it is made
very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of white with a
border of gold to imitate alabaster. And after you have
applied the white, you can burnish it with the tooth.
But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to mix the lead
white with glair of egg & peelings from the fig
tree. Or better, varnish your work with white varnish.
In addition when you are molding with paper, as it starts to dry,
burnish from the back with the tooth.


Plaster

That from the mountains is greyer, and the the
one from the region of Albi is whiter. It must be heated over a
closed fire, such as a reverberatory furnace or fours
de barbiers. And the most freshly cooked is the best. It must
be finely ground on marble. After having prepared your
cavity from sulfur or something else, & oiling it,
& having enclosed it in a circle, temper not too
thickly your plaster with water, & separate it well
with your finger, and if it makes pustules, throw in
more powder of the said plaster &  grind it
with the finger until +

+ it makes no more pustules. Then cast & sprinkle
once again with plaster powder & leave to set well, then
scrape off the powder.

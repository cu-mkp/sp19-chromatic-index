Molding hollow for seals or other things

Firstly, model your representation in wax on a piece of
glass or smooth slate. Next, mold it with our
above-said sand, l’ having firstly smeared lightly
with oil, as you know, & then rubbed with eau-de-vie,
having and wetting your sand with hot water. Having
the hollow, cast it in alloyed lead, in the same format as other
representations that you make very neatly. However, if it did not come
out at all neatly, repair it. And then, cast somemold
with somewax, on the relief of lead, & you will
have a very neat hollow in the wax, which comes out very neatly
on the lead. Next, in the hollow of wax, cast your wet
sand, which will make for you a relief, on which you will cast your
hollow in silver or another metal for seals. But, note
that one ought not make your hollow with melted wax, but rather,
only heated in warm water, or, even better, in warm
urine. Or else, if you have a relief of gold or
silver, or other metal, very faço neat
& repaired, imprint on top your hollow of wax, & then in
the latter, cast your sand, which will come out in relief, on which,
next, you will cast your hollow for seals or other works. You could even
cast a hollow on the principal part of the metal relief, &
even with lead & tin, which will not melt at all the
principal part if it is with a pinceau lightly smeared
with crushed chalk, or smoked with candle smoke or with
glair of dried egg.

When you have imprinted your seal of
wax, mold in noyau this piece of wax, which is
hollow, like your seal, & your noyau will render it molded,
similar to u the imprint & the seal.



It is necessary that your wax be mixed with some color which
hardly has body, in order that you see the imprint better. Lamp
smoke or soot black is good for this. White wax , for
this effect, is exc better.


Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal

Having cast your first mold, mix dcrocum or well-ground iron scales to firm it up.
And having set, & rendered your hollow part very neat, take some
paste of fine

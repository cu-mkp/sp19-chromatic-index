For making gray wood

One needs to take three half setiers of iron
filings for xviii sdeniers of
alung de glace, & for as much green copperas,
for six deniers of verdigris, pitch,
& a quart of cuyrcurrier
water, and if you cannot find it, you will put morerainwater of slight degree. 


For gilding on wood

First one needs to lay down a coat of glue very clear, and
once dry, you will lay down a coat of yellow gold. And when it is
done, you will take fig tree wood, & put it to soak
some space of time, & wash the places you want to gild, and
cut your gold with a knife to the price that you will
lay down. And one must lay down the said gold with
cotton. And if you can find fig tree,
take the the white of one egg & stir it vigorously.



If your gold does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
a partridge feather, & make it burn it in a
chafing-dish, and make the smoke go against what you have
gilded.


For gilding with or moulu

One needs to take a
coquille of gold
and, before you want to work with it, you will soak it with gum
water and lay it down with a pinsseau, &
polish it with a skinwolf's tooth once it
is dry.


Recipe for putting all woods in color

For making it black, one needs to soak it in olive
oil. And the horn, in a similar case, four or five
days, & then boil it there where it has soaked
for the space of one hour, & take it out of the
oil, and take some natural sulphur or another

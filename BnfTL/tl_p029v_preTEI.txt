Color of gold without gold on silver

Color your applied silver leaf with terre
emerita, and once dry, give a coat of spike
lavender oil varnish and of sandarac. And it will be
more beautiful than tinsel.


Layer of burnished gold on paper

Make your ground layer of starch soaked in water &
your gold will burnish very well. Clear starch water
layered on the paper, then dried, & repeated in this manner 3
times, is a good layer for burnished gold on simple paper
& has no body.


Removing stains

Good eau-de-vie removes them if you rub the garment with it.




Ground layer of gold

Ground terra emerita with some saffron, all
of it mixed with very clear colle forte & passed
through a linen cloth.


Extraction of oils

Apothecaries say that anything which does not adhere to
the mortar while being ground is
oleaginous.


Dragon's blood

Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red.
And in a glass bottle put the best eau-de-vie you can find, in sufficient quantity. For
it And stop it well and so quickly that it does not evanesce,
otherwise it would be worth nothing. And leave it thus for a
long time, because the longer it stays there, the
more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is
good, otherwise it will become like lees. When you want to use
it, make a small hole in the stopper of the bottle & pour a
little & stop it again each time, then apply it on gold.

The good kind of dragon's blood can be found in
large pieces like torteauthis one has no value and is
adulterated & once broken it shows on its edges scales,
transparent as rorouge clair enamel, it is
also lumpy in some parts like small rubies. The eau-de-vie needs to be very ardent &
passed several times.



The darker dragon's blood is the best & has more of
a tint; the tear is found in gr pieces like
peas and large hazelnuts which look like





I put it in common eau-de-vie, mixing in some
aquafortis to give it strength. At the beginning the
water took on a slight tint, but at the end there was only an
appearance of tragacanth gum with which I think they adulterate
the dragon's blood.



When it is applied on burnished gold, it is prone to break. For
this reason, some coat it with turpentine varnish. Cold delays
the action of the water and the extraction of the color. And for
this reason, you can keep it by the fire.

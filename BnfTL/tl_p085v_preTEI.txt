Founder

They mix beaten glair of egg with earth with which they make
the first layer of the chappe of pieces, & bells, & all
other pieces, saying that the said glair makes it come out
d neatly, & makes it settle, & seats the
substance. In the noyau for a small work, glair is also
good.

Rosette, to come out neatly, wants the mold
to be a little hot & lead, which was also mixed with the
rosette, similarly for small pieces.


Mortars

It is necessary that they be of the finest substance possible, such
as copper for cauldrons, which is better than
rosette, in order that it sustains the blow better.

Also the mortars for pestling are stronger & less in
danger of breaking if they are of fine copper. And for a
private home, they do not ring so much & do not
carry as much noise as those of
metal. It is true that those that are
of metal have more of a ring for the
apothecaries.

Grenades must be of fine metal


Sand from a mine

It wants to be well reheated for great metals. Some burn it
in the furnace until it is very black, and grind it finely on
porphyry. Others burn it with asphaltum, @but
when it is too burned, it does not mold so neatly, because it does not
have body, and is too lean. You can give some with tripoly or
burned felt.


Sand experiments

I have experimented with sand from
Th{oulous}e, & after having reheated it well,
twice, in a skillet, I passed it through a fine sieve,
like the apothecariesâ€™ double, without finely
grinding it further on the porphyry, as I have done
previously. I moistened it with wine boiled with elm
root, and molded with it a large piece of a portrait of
Jesus. I found it easy to release, without having it to knock
on it Jen & molded neatly with one side in
relief, & on the other in cavity, & of the thickness of a
coin of forty sols. I cast very hot

Sand from a mine, well chosen & well reheated, is the most
excellent of all, without looking for any other mixtures, because it
receives all metals. It does not want to be used hot, because it
makes things porous. The most finely ground for big works is not the
best, because it does have enough body to withstand

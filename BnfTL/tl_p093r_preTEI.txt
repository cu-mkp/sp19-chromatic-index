Olives

They are spoiled if once per month one does not
refresh their salt water, and one ought not to touch
with their hands, for this makes them spoils.


Observation from rustics

That when it freezes on Palm Sunday, it
freezesall the months of the year

That when the first flowers fall les suiv &
are lost from the frost, the others are usually lost
also.


Grafts

It is necessary that the graft not be from old wood for it is never
a beautiful tree.

One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, & it
does not have enough strength for taking cuttings.

Trees which have coarse marrow, like peach trees & all
their kind &the plum trees, do not want grafts in
freezing weather because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.

All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree will be sapping,
for the humor grows them quickly. Otherwise
au, they dry too quickly that the humor of
the sap does not grow them.


Sand

The white ash of all woods, which still sticks to the
wood that burns, and which has not fallen into the
bohearth, molds very
neatly.


Sand

Asheswell pulverized tallow molds &
releases very neatly. The one from the kitchens, which is fat
& shiny, from the big kitchens, is better.

Finely pulverized quicklime works. The same for broken up
flint,which works better in the cavity.

 like other things, & on this occasion, you can cast in two or
three times until your mold is full. As for the mold which
is of white plaster, pulverized & reheated as for
previous sands, you should have made it a long time ago, for
it serves several times. But before you use it, soak it for a good
hour in cold water & for at least
as long in water so hot, that, at
the beginning, you cannot hold your finger in it.
And q take heed that it does not imbibe
b more,thusly but rather that it shows
itself to be very wet everywhere, without the water being imbibed in it.
And, removing it from the hot water, closed, cast your wax
in such a state of heat as has been said. And readily, neither the first
nor second cast come out until the mold is imbibed. Let it cool
before opening it, in order that the cast thing does not break. You will
recognize that the cast is good when the wax spilled out onto the
outside of the mold is thin and smooth. Remember to make many
gates all along the mold, in order that the wax may thus run
better.

Make the first

 gate twice as large as for other molds. And if, in
the first cast, your work becomes porous and does not come out neat,
, it is all the same, for it is necessary that you
realise that the three of four first ones are not readily good. In the
first one, you recognize if there are some flashings, which keep from
releasing well and you remove them if they do not remove
themselves at the second or third first cast. And the more
you cast, the neater you will make it, and your mold will serve
you for more than a hundred times, if it is well overseen. But it is
good to soak it one night or one
day before casting in it, in order that it be well
imbibed. The same must be done for fruits of sugar. This
wax is very doulce & amiable & pliant as
copper, and if it is strong because of the sulphur, which
renders it melted, far before the other, that you can thusly prove on a
hot slate. And the sulfur that you will have put
in it, will be found, the second time that you melt it, cracked at the
bottom. Having thusly passed through the wax, it does not inflame
from a candle. And on this occasion, que I
think it will cast very neatly for medals. One uses the same wax
in place of varnish to etch 


When your animal is cast, cut with a hot penknife the flaws
& superfluous things. And if you want to refold it & twist it
around on some stick or taper, put it to soften
on in hot water, and hold it while twisting it
around.


Cut down the protuberance of the gates, in order that they are smooth
& that the wax has more of the silver to run, in one
go, without turning around in the folds of the snake.

Second Cast

When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is the
back, the backbone, and the entire top part, and the
len half-mold where it is enclosed has set
and is hard enough

 uncover the whole bottom part & side of the belly,
# first with a knife& tant
at the thickest places, & then with a pen-knife, where the
most delicate parts are enclosed, such as the legs, the tail, &
similar things, and because the head is higher, you will also need to
look for it & uncover deeper, and made a deeper notch there which
ought to release easily. That is to say widening by the outside, in order that
the second mold that you will cast on it can come out well,
which even the animal can help with, which is malleable and obedient,
having naturalness. However ad, be more scrupulous
when uncovering the throat of the lizard rather than the
snake, for the lizard has big jaws & big bones
that are not malleable, and has hollow ears, where the wet sand has
entered, is not aff easy to release. But you will
avoid all of this, if you uncover half of the head and those things that
you know do not release easily. Once everything is uncovered well, blow
on top & wipe each part, by wiping with little cloths of
swine fur, slightly moistened by the end, with a
little saliva, or with clear water, as you dissolve
it, in order that your the uncovered lower part of your
animal will be very neat. #üùã With this done, dip le
revyour mold your mold, for the length
of a pater noster in water, not
dule the uncovered side but
opposite, & the reverse of the uncovered thing. And this is in order that,
by sucking the waterinside, the oil with which
you smear after the other side pour eviter, is not
imbibed at all, but remains on the surface & prevents the second
cast that you will cast on it from attaching to it. Having therefore
thusly dipped the reverse of your mold in the
water, take a pinceau especially dedicated to
this, & en oings with it smear some oil
the whole surface of the mold, except the animal, which must in
no way touch the oil, & take head to retrace & smear well
with the point of a pinceau between the parts &
through all the delicate parts. And if by chance the oil is
imbibed, dip the mo reverse of the mold as
mentioned in water, & you will see the oil return to
the surface in little drops.



Mold small animals like big ones, except that you need to make
delicates points of filcistcittern strings, both long & short.



Remove with your small flat pincers, all the
points.

and then

However, leave the point of the throat, so that it serves as a
clue to find the head, which is deeper down than any other part, because
when making the arrangement you arranged it higher. It is also at the
level of the head that you should make the biggest notch & start
with this one to uncover, and follow the rest through the trace of the
points.

#

And if some bit of nail from a leg, or from a tail, or from another
should separate from the mold, put y
between but a small grain of wax, & with the point of a
hot iron wire, join it then adapt your mold with a
knife, & make there notches at the sides, so that the other
half binds to it.üùã

and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your
fingers and to easily pestle it in a metal
mortar, or better yet, in an iron one. Next, it
will be easy to grind it, not only on common
marblethat would corrode, but on
porphyry, and it is necessary that it be finely ground
with water so that when putting it on your
fingernail, you find it soft without any asperity like
the colors that the painters grind for oil. You can
use au lii this one, once dry, in a box mold instead
of sand, without moistening it with anything nor reheating it. If you do
not like it, fumigate the cavity with sulfur smoke or de
p with the tip of the flame of a wax candle
that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat & shiny &
polished work, in pure lead & tin. I would
say the same for finely pulverized tripoly that does not want to
be not reheated or moistened. Burnt linen gives less
trouble than others, because it does not need to be reheated, nor
moistened, & molds and releases very neatly &
very, subtlety & releases well neat, like the
previous ones & withstands several castings. First you ought to burn
it with a flame, then leave it to rest & to be consumed with its
fire until it is completely dead, then finely grind it on
marble or on a paper. But because a
lot And if you reheat it in a crucible, red hot due to
the fire, to render all of it fine & impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of linen is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold & cover it, and fill the box
mold with crushed slate, which molds also very neatly, but
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful & the neatest.
If you cast at your convenience soft tin that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that pewterers sell, comes out
very neatly & approaching the color of silver, without mixing
in anything else, it is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &
so that the molded object should be four fingers away
from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, so
hotwith such a degree of heat that it
promptly burns a paper or straw placed
inside, by simmering. Then remove it from the fire & leave it to
rest a little & cast the tin mixed

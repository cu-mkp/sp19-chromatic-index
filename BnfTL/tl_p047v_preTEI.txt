A drink having a taste of wine

Take tartar from large vessels & dilute it in
water & it will have the taste of wine.


Founding

Some, to make it run neatly, put halfmetal &
halfcopper. Others take one part of
potin & one part of copperlatten. Others take one part of candlestick
latten & one part of basin latten. And among
basins, the latten of larger ones is more brittle than that of
skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones which have a more
ample round shape, a more brittle substance can be taken. In any event,
the most brittle latten runs better, & casts more neatly, but
it must be cast very neat hot. One When one wants
to cast, one casts lead into the substance, which makes it flow
& run & goes up in smoke, & keeps the mold from
corrupting. And if you want to cast fire pieces, mix in more
rosette than latten, so that it is less breakable. The
crucibles for melting metal should be better than
those for glassmakers for glass is not as
heavy as metal. And in this instance, one needs to lute the
crucibles with earth and crushed glass.


Crucibles

Those made in winter & humid
weather are not good. Those of the founders should be thick
and should be luted.


Cast

Finely calcinated pumice stone casts 22 caratgold without repair, but it needs to be ablaze and red like the
metal. And it withstands several casts.

with the substance of a skillet mixed with a knob that is
potin. And before that, I had so reheated my molded
frame, now with the flame of my furnace, now putting
lit charcoals on top of it, that it became almost red. I let it
cool and cast. It came out very neatly in relief on one side & in
cavity on the other, as well for the figure as the letters. It is true
that the material was whitish, as almost metallic, but this was because
of the potin. I made another cast with substance of
skillet, alone in the same sand, but not so reheated, it did not
come out well.

Since then I molded the bone of oxen feet, burned,
pulverized, & sieved through a double sieve
& humfort moistened with
glair of egg or wine boiled with elm root. I knocked
on it moderately while molding. Having undone theopened the
frame, I found that the figures had not released neatly &
left the molds floury-like & crumbling. I
les moistened the bone sand further, so that
it stuck together well in the  between my
fingers, and in this way, I molded neatly with a good
release. And even though it seemed to me that the pulverised bone
was lumpy, if there is some substance of skillet thrown in, my
figures came out very neatly. It is true that I had very very reheated
my frame, it withstood only one cast. I find that
when a sand is so finely grounded that it renders itself dense as
ceruse & even, like without knowing it to be arid,
rarefied, areneux & rather spongy, that it molds
very neatly, but it does not receive metal so well, as if it were
porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fat & even, it
becomes porous & does not receive fine lines. I believe that
the secret to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives the
metal well, one for lead, the other for another, for each
one has its particular one. Let it be molded slowly & carefully, and
leave it for a few days to become compact by itself, if you have the
time for this. And next, reheat it very well not all at once nor over
with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it crumbles &
always has some fault. Finally, you ought to cast the copper or
latten or other great metals very hot, & if it
possible in large quantities of substance, which contain more heat than
small quantities. It is necessary that the frame be cold, &
that you cast all at once. Always lute the entrance of your
frame, for the metal, touching iron or
metal, 


This bone wants to be well crushed in a mortar, and does
not want be reheated because it crumbles.
